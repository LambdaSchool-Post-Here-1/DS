# Data Collection and Pre-Processing

There are so many new and emerging tech products on the market, that it wasn't even a question whether we will need to update our model in the future. Thus, we created scripts to properly fetch data on demand (timer (thursday?)) to train our model on.

## Contents
*clean_preprocess.py* - Cleans and preprocesses fetched data, and preprocesses input using same techniques for use in predictions.
*fetch_data.py* - Fetches the top 100 results for reach of the following subreddits:
