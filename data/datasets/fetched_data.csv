24hoursupport,"Problem with network adapter?

I’m having problems with my network adapter (the driver) on my laptop constantly disconnecting me. I’ve tried updating it both with it searching automatically and manually updating it and I seem to have the correct and most update one (HP ENVY 15 NOTEBOOK PC). When disconnected, I can reset the adapter through troubleshooting and it seems to work, but it’s only a temporary fix that doesn’t last long. What should I do?"

24hoursupport,"Issue began when I left the room and returned to a loud whirring from the fans and then the pc shut itself off. Since then I would boot to no signal.
Replaced my old GTX 1060 3GB with a new RTX 2060 SUPER 8 GB, as I believed no signal = video issue therefore is likely the video card. 
The issue has improved slightly, as the screen now powers up (only on hdmi monitor, the one on display port only connects occasionally.) After the initial turn on screen, with the pc specialist logo and a loading symbol it has only done one of 3 things.

1) Gone immediately to a black screen, screen remains on, no signal to display port monitor.

2) Pc specialist screen loading symbol is replaced with ""automatic repair in process"" and is followed up by saying that the computer couldn't boot properly and recommends a restart.

3) Boots into lock screen, upon pressing spacebar to get to my password screen the screen freezes, then goes black.

Safe mode with networking has worked. I updated Nvidia drivers to latest using manuel install, as the geforce experience app doens't work in safe mode.
Even in this mode I am yet to be able to connect to my primary (display port) monitor.

I am out of ideas as I have reset windows fully with a wipe to check for corrupt OS, I have pulled out all peripherals to check them, reinstalled the GPU several times and replaced each cable one by one individually, cleaning out dust as I went. Even entered all my components into PC Part Picker to  check for potential power issues as I have bought a significantly larger GPU.

The computer was ok for what I needed but I ran into a problem where it didn't even have enough memory to download the Windows 10 updates.

I have removed everything possible from the computer. Is there a way to reset this PC? If I'm having these issues, I'm guessing it might not even be worth doing (who would want to buy the machine?). What alternatives do I have?  Could I turn it into a Linux machine or is it just garbage?

24hoursupport,"Hello,

Recently I keep having problems with my msi laptop. 
When turn I on the laptop the screens stays black and the power buttons is blinking between orange and blue.
I can't get in the bios or any other settings. 

I tried to remove the battery for a couple of hours but sadly that didn't work. 
I opened up the laptop and everything seems in order. 
The strangest thing is, when I boot up the laptop the screens stays black, then if I close the lid of the laptop and wait for 5 a 10 minutes I get the screen back and it starts up windows. But if I  reboot the laptop again or turn it off/on the screens stays black again.

What can I do?"
24hoursupport,"So, I don’t know too much about PCs, which is why I came here, but a couple weeks ago, my pc has just been being a lot slower than usual.

So any help would be appreciated."
24hoursupport," This one's pretty long so sit tight. About a week and a half ago, I started having issues with sound on my PC. Everything except for Spotify and the built in sound tests got significantly quieter, and it's only been getting worse. At first, 100% volume would sound like 30% used to, but it was still usable. Now, I can't even watch YouTube or use discord because there is next to no sound at all. I updated all drivers, the Logitech software, my computer, restarted the computer, and it still didn't fix it. Next, I went into the control panel, to sound, and exhausted every option in there, again to no avail. After that, I decided to get a hold of a Microsoft employee who just told me to update drivers, and that's about where I gave up on trying to fix the sound issue directly. So I decided I would reset my computer. I chose the option to keep all of my personal files when resetting, and during the reset, got the message ""there was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made."" I looked it up, and attempted to fix the issue by running the system file checker (""sfc /scannow"" in the command prompt). When doing that, I got the error message ""Windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation"" at 71% completion each time I tried. To fix this, I went into safe mode to try again, encountered the same issue, and my last option was to run ""CHKDSK"" in the command prompt, which it successfully did, but did not fix either of the previous issues with the SFC or reset in general. At this point I am desperate. Does anyone have any ideas? The most confusing part to me is that Spotify and the sound tests in settings still work."

Hi,

I'd greatly appreciate any help/advice. My P52 started to randomly shut off a couple days ago (unfortunately a week after my one-year warranty expired). There's no warning before a shut down, and the only way I can get it to boot up again is to remove and reinsert the battery.

I've noticed a bunch of symptoms that may be related. **My P52 shuts off:**

1. **A few moments after plugging in the charger** (even when the battery has >50% charge).
2. **When using Lenovo Vantage to run a hardware test** (sometimes it gets all the way through, without finding any issues, including for the battery).
3. **When using the Lenovo Diagnostics Tool to check the battery.** I charged it over night and was able to finally full the full test today, which found no issues.
4. **Even after removing the battery and only using the charger.** This has been one of the more stable ways for me to use my laptop though, which lasts more than a couple of hours this way. If this happens, I can only reboot the laptop after unplugging and reinserting the adapter.

I tried a Battery Gauge Reset in Lenovo Vantage, which failed and gave this error message: ""Failed: AC power adapter was detached"". I wonder if this has something to do with it as well, since the power adapter was plugged in.

This seems like a hardware issue to me, but hopefully I'm wrong. Has anyone experienced something similar? What fix worked for you? Thank you."
24hoursupport,"So the deal is with them is that they use a Y splitter (Using 2 audio cables, one for the headphone jack, one for the mic jack, both 3.5 mm) and my pc isn't picking up the mic audio.  I made sure that physical mute button on the headset was not pressed, and I did make sure that the mic was selected and turned on for apps to receive audio. The reason this is an ""Odd case"" is because the headphones pick up audio themselves, not the mic; Specifically the right headphone does (So if I were to put the right headphone over my mouth, you'd be able to hear me). It almost seems as if when they were being manufactured, someone messed up and put the microphone's components into the right headphone."

24hoursupport,"We have a 32” Samsung flatscreen, model number: LN37A450C1H that is stuck in hospitality mode. It didn’t come with the original remote, so I have a C3 universal remote paired to it.

We got it into a menu and chose factory reset, however, we still cannot change sources and the universal remote disconnected from the tv. We managed to connect the remote again, but it only half of the time turns the tv on, and otherwise the power light on the tv flickers when you’re trying to press any buttons while it’s on. 

We have tried multiple codes: mute + 1 + 1 + 9 + enter, as well as mute + 1 + 8 + 2 + enter, but it only turns the tv on at this point. Mind you, mute, 1, 1, 9, enter worked the first time before the failed factory reset. We just want to be able to hook up our Chromecast to get it to function.

I've been hardcore grinding this game out like every day for about 10 hrs straight. I think it's a temperature issue but I don't want to buy some new thermal paste until I know that's definitely the issue.

My CPU has been sitting at 80 temp for quite a while now. Whenever a graphics heavy game is open, my CPU always sits at around 75 degrees and my NZXT program CAM tells me each time my CPU reaches past 80 degrees, its happened a lot of times. I don't know if this is the culprit, and if it is, why is it so sudden to great, beautiful graphics, into a potato that my computer from 10 years ago can run better?

I run on all SSD's so from the limited research that I've done, defragging isn't a realistic option. Ive ran multiple virus scans, I even installed the free version of MalwareBytes, but to no avail. I have what I think are essential hardware monitoring applications like Z-GPU and HWMonitor but I have no idea what I am looking at and or if its bad or not.

I've been looking at ways to solve this for hours now, posted on multiple Subreddits, posted on multiple live chats but seems like there's no help there either. I am a newbie, and a ""GAMER"" so maybe they don't want to help the 'normie' out? I don't know. I'm pretty fed up now though.

This usually happens when someones shooting a gun, or throws a grenade, however it can happen at anytime, regardless if there's nothing going on at that moment. It never happens in the menus or when I'm just on my desktop. The problem doesn't fix itself if I turn down the graphics settings, I can have 130 fps with a solid 50 ping and it will still happen. I've tried a lot, any suggestions or theories on what causes this is appreciated, I've lost a lot of 1v1's in csgo or valorant because of this."
24hoursupport,"Hi all,

I just built my new gaming PC a few weeks ago everything was working fine until I started to get black screens and it was defective, everything else was working perfectly though. As soon as I inserted my new graphics card (along with a fresh install of windows) my headphones stopped working. My monitor audio still works and it windows says there is a sound output going through the headphones but I hear nothing. The headphones work perfectly fine with other devices and I have used my other headphones aswell. My headphones are set to my primary device and I have reinstalled/uninstalled my motherboard realtek drivers many times but I have had no luck. I have used older drivers aswell! Can I fix anything or is there something wrong with my motherboard/gpu.I have an AMD B450M pro4 asrock mother-board and a radeon rx 5700 gaming x for my gpu.I am running a legit version of windows and have no malware installed. Also, I have tried all trouble shooting guides.

Thank you in advance!"
24hoursupport,"I rarely use my laptop maybe power on once or twice a month if that.

Last night I was trying to install Linux Mint Cinnamon on a separate PC (HP), I had it burned on a thumb drive via Rufus. After the HP was not recognizing it I decided to plug it back into my laptop (Lenovo U530) to see if something was wrong.

When I went and put the thumb drive in my laptop I realized my laptop was off and with the thumb drive inserted. My Lenovo loaded the splash screen and went black. As I panicked I pulled the thumb drive and powered off the laptop.

I went to start the laptop again and it was stuck at the initial Lenovo black screen.

I was able to use the button to get into the boot menu and attempted to do a system recovery. It got almost all the way done and said recovery failed.

I shut it off for the night and surrendered.

Today I was able to get a bootable win10 USB to see if I could repair it, so I could have one working PC.

When I inserted the Win10 thumb drive I went to Novo and selected boot from thumb drive. It loaded the black Lenovo screen with the circle made of dots. Then nothing happened besides this odd sequence of dots.

24hoursupport,"Hi  everyone, first time poster here, (hope it's ok to post this here). A  couple of days ago I optimized my laptop for music production with  Ableton. I had always had latency issues and this fixed them, so I was  really happy. I did all the basic stuff like use a high performance  power plan, updated drivers, removed programs from startup, disabled  anti-virus, etc. I updated Windows 10 to the most recent update and  things were still running smoothly. Then, two days ago, I noticed  Ableton's CPU meter was spiking at 50-60% when idle. Before it was maybe  2% tops. When playing a track, it spiked up to 133% CPU.

I  ran Latencymon and Windows Performance Analyzer which indicated  ""dxgkrnl.sys"" as the culprit. Digging through endless threads on several  forums I learned that dxgkrnl.sys is probably just a red herring and  it's probably a faulty or inadequate internet or graphics driver.

I've  tried changing the drivers (didn't use third party programs), enabling  and disabling them and the problem persists. I have no audio dropouts  while watching videos and Latencymon/Windows Performance Analyzer show  no problems if i'm not running Ableton.

Some  other fixes i've tried but haven't been succesful include disabling  Speedstate, disabling Intel services (except Storage Technology which  last time forced me to system restore), deleted old drivers, disabled  USB and Wi-Fi drivers, disabled bluetooth, Cortana and Windows search,  turned game mode off, threatened my laptop with physical violence and  finally, begged the laptop to work again. So far, no luck.

I'm running Ableton 10 (x64) on a Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-5000 CPU @ 1.80Ghz with 8GB RAM.

GPU in Task Manager says:

Intel (R) HD Graphics Family  
AMD Radeon HD 8600M Series

I  hope someone can help me out. It seems to be a common problem, but I  can't find a specific fix for mine. Thank you in advance, so, so, much."

I even forgot i had my tv connected to my PC so yesterday i decided to watch a movie on it. but my TV didn't show up in nvidia control panel.

So i DDUd my driver installed latest version same issue. Unplugged the HDMI cable from TV and PC waited like 10 mins then tried again still no go.

I have 2 monitors 1 with displayport and the other on DVI they work no issues there. Seems only the HDMI is causing issues. Tried with a different HDMI cable still same issue.

Tried my displayport monitor with the HDMI cable seems it's the same issues no HDMI signal. So is the HDMI port fried ?If so why/how ? it used to work a few months ago (think it stopped working on newer driver versions) last time i used my TV with my PC since then i haven't changed anything (besides driver updates).

Hi everyone,

First off, I'm not great with PCs so sorry if what I'm saying makes no sense.  I just expect computers to work when I switch them on and I'm stuck when there's a problem :)  Also, I'm typing this on my phone so apologies for any formatting issues.

I've had my PC for just over a year after buying it pre-built online.  For the last 6 months I've been getting intermittent BSODs with a ""Machine Check Exception"" for the stop code.  Sometimes it doesn't bluescreen and will just freeze entirely and the only thing I can do is reboot my PC.

This usually happens when I'm playing games or watching YouTube.  Some games seem to crash my computer more than others.  If I'm playing World of Warships then it's pretty much guaranteed to freeze up regularly at least once every hour.  But when I'm playing World of Warcraft it's only frozen a couple of times in the last 100 hours of gametime.  It's never frozen while playing Rocket League.  It feels completely random.

For YouTube, I could be just watching a video and it will freeze for no apparent reason.

What I've tried:

I've been in touch with the company I bought the PC off and they've not been particularly helpful.  A lot of what they've said doesn't make sense to me as my computer knowledge isn't great.  The last thing they recommended was to run a test on my RAM but I completely replaced my RAM recently from 8gb to 16gb and I'm still having problems.  I explained this to them but they're reluctant to take the computer back and have a look themselves which I guess is understandable with how busy and short staffed everyone is right now with Coronavirus.

I've completely reinstalled Windows 10.

As I mentioned, I've completely replaced my RAM from 8gb to 16gb.

I've cleaned out my case of any dust and checked for loose connections and wires.

I took an old graphics card out of my last computer (a 660) and used that for a bit but my computer still crashed.

I checked for overheating and everything seems fine.  I reapplied thermal paste to my processor just in case.

And I've done all the regular updates, virus checks and driver updates aswell.

I've tried troubleshooting online but I don't understand a lot of it.

Any advice or help would be massively appreciated.  It's driving me crazy and I'm close to just buying a new PC which I don't really want to do right now, especially as my current PC isn't that old.

Thanks :)"

Now, this phone costs more then my phone that's in service.

Android,"Device reviews are everywhere these days. From big name technology websites to lesser known blogs, and to the rising stars on YouTube. You can find hours upon hours of review content on most any well-known device out there. However a lot of these places do not focus on long term usage and fail to mention how devices hold up over the long term.

Additionally for those of you who like to hear about devices from actual users, it's hard to find a good place with reviews that aren't scattered all over the place.

This thread is where you, the /r/android community, can share your experiences with your device. Hopefully users who read this thread can gain some valuable insight into a device they're researching to see if they want to buy it. This week we are focusing on [Oppo](https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo-phones-82.php), [Realme](https://www.gsmarena.com/realme-phones-118.php) and [Vivo](https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo-phones-98.php). All three companies are part of a bigger conglomerate called BBK Electronics along with OnePlus who have already been covered earlier.

Oppo are an electronics company based in China and started off by focusing on Blu-ray players and audio accessories. Interestingly, that part of Oppo has shut down and they mainly focus on smartphones and smartphone accessories today. Oppo were among the first to announce a phone with a 1080p display on the [Find 5](https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_find_5-5161.php). Additionally they were also the first to partner with CyanogenInc and ship a commercially available [phone](https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_n1-5724.php) running CyanogenMod. This phone, the Oppo N1 was also the first phone to have a rotating camera. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau and Realme CEO Sky Li used to work at Oppo before taking their positions at OnePlus and Realme respectively.

Realme started off as a sub-brand of Oppo but quickly spun off after the success of their first product, the [Realme 1](https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_1-9200.php). Realme are best known for their price-performance ratio as seen with phones like the [Realme X2 Pro](https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_x2_pro-9904.php) and [Realme 6](https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_6-10113.php). 

Vivo are well-known for experimenting with hardware, they were the first to launch a [phone](https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_x20_plus_ud-9005.php) with a fingerprint reader under the display and were among the first to launch a [phone](https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_nex_s-9227.php) with a pop-up camera. They manufactured a [phone](https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_nex_dual_display-9435.php) with dual displays and showcased concept [phones](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/24/18195191/vivo-apex-2019-announced-specs-features) with no [ports](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21157292/vivo-apex-2020-concept-phone-cameras-screen-specs).

We decided to combine these three manufacturers into one thread due to several reasons. Oppo and Realme share similar hardware. Phones from both companies also ship with Oppo's skin, Color OS although Realme's phones now run a slightly customized version called Realme UI. Vivo were included along with them since they focus mainly on Asia. We were unsure if a standalone Vivo thread would get enough attention. Furthermore they are also a subsidiary of BBK Electronics just like Oppo, OnePlus and Realme.

We have completed a few review threads now and will do a few more in the future since a few of the biggest OEM's by market share haven't been covered yet.

Android,"It was described as the [""Android upgrade fix""](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3306443/what-is-project-treble-android-upgrade-fix-explained.html) that would change the way Android is updated and rid itself of a plague that's stood the test of time: getting updates into the hands of users, not only faster, but more often. This fix was known as ""Treble"".

Except, what I just described was actually launched in 2017. [Android Authority at the time wrote an article](https://www.androidauthority.com/project-treble-818225/), explaining the concepts behind the ambition.

Yet, in the time since, as we near the beta and eventual launch of Android 11, 3 major versions since Treble, not a whole lot has actually changed.

3 months ago, [I decided to look at the problem myself](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ezrb1y/how_many_android_devices_get_os_updates_2020/) using data from GSMArena, and the situation is poor.

As it stands today, **the Google Pixel series of phones only get 3 years of OS updates**.

So, Treble, the fragmentation problem solver, provided a pathetic 1 additional year of OS updates compared to the days of the Nexus 5 where it only got 2 major OS updates.

Of the total [419](https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2018&nYearMax=2018&sOSes=2) devices launched in 2017, only [40](https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2018&nYearMax=2018&sOSes=2) run Android 10.

[Devices like the ""vivo Y91""](https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_y91-9480.php) launched and died on Android 8.1.

And Google's response to this situation? Obfuscate the truth.

The removal of the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/) that tracked the month by month version development's were an admission that despite Google's efforts, their initiatives have failed.

The maximum update period you can get on any Android smartphone today is just **3 years**. 

The [Samsung S8](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s8-8161.php), a phone capable of running the next 5 years of OS, launched on 7.0 and died with 9.0, just **two** major releases.

Treble has not helped.  
Apex has not helped.   
Devices do not get longer OS updates nor security updates.

It is not possible to fix this issue, due to Android's architecture.

We brought into the hype, Google left us disappointed, and tried to hide the true extent of their failure. We should demand more.

As so, as we near the Android 11 beta, feel free to keep track of how many devices that launched with 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 actually get the update.

We can guess already: only a select few. Yet _every_ Android 10.0 on the market should get 11.0 on day _1_ of the OS release.

That day will never come."
Android,"In short, UnityAdsCache is exactly what is sounds like: An ad that is cached on your phone by unity. This can be in the form of a video or photo, and usually takes up several hundred kilobytes to several megabytes of space.


**To remove these**: Search your files for ""UnityAdsCache"" and delete every folder that shows up. You might also need to search your camera roll / photos for the ads. You won't be losing anything of value :)


**Why and how does Unity store these?**: Unity stores ads on your phone so you can be shown an ad at any time, even when you don't have an internet connection. Some apps use Unity ads for monetization; the app lets Unity download their ads to a sort of sandbox directory in your files that is just for that app.


**When do these ads go away?**: The ads stay on your phone until you manually delete them. You probably have a sizeable chunk of storage lost to these ads if you're an avid mobile gamer.


**How do I prevent getting these ads in the future?**: For starters, look on the Google Play store to see if an app you want has ads. Also consider buying the premium version of an app to support devs without ads. Otherwise, you can get a system-wide adblocker like Blockada which will block Unity from downloading ads to your phone.


**What can I do to help other people know about this?**: Write a one star review on the app that hosts the Unity ads, saying that you want it removed. Report the app to Google Play for being malicious. Tell friends with Androids to delete UnityAdsCache files. Email Unity support to give them a piece of your mind."

Android,"Android needs a good competitor to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon. Luckily, 2021 is looking to be a game-changing year for Samsung’s mobile chips. Exynos chips were ahead of Snapdragon or at least equal until the Galaxy S8. Now, they’re not as fast as Snapdragon, uses too much power, and generates too much heat. With the supposedly Exynos 1000 (if that is the name), it seems like Samsung is looking to change that with these specs. These are my predictions along with others’ but feel free to add your own. ARM just announced their Cortex A78, Cortex-X1, Mali G78, and N78 designs. 

Exynos 1000:

Samsung 5nm LPE process

CPU - 2x Cortex-X1, 2x Cortex-A78, 4x Cortex A55 (Based on past chips configurations)

(I honestly would not mind if Samsung went with 4x Cortex A78. 2 cores maybe have relaxed pitches or something like that to have higher frequencies and better performance and 2 cores have tighter pitches for slightly lower performance and better efficiency. The 50% lower power figure that ARM gave was very impressive). 

GPU - AMD Radeon graphics based architecture (I am hoping RDNA 2. RDNA 1 is good, but RDNA 2 has another 50% perf./watt increase over RDNA 1). They might also do a more custom GPU that has some AMD graphics IP incorporated. AMD is rumored to be releasing RDNA 2 graphics cards this year, so RDNA 2 on Exynos 1000 is definitely possible. The Mali G78 still sucks.

The 5G modem is most likely external again. If it was incorporated into the Exynos 1000 chip, it would generate too much heat and actually cause the chip to throttle. 

I hope they have a more advanced thermal cooling solution for that high sustained performance in games and more. 

Other wishes: Hopefully, they make it just slightly more thicker for a bigger battery. I’m also hoping that they make Exynos uniform from 2021 and beyond. By having 2 different chips, they make it harder to optimize both for all kinds of things from performance, camera software, OS updates, etc. By having one single chip for a device, it is easier to optimize it for better efficiency and performance.

I sincerely hope Exynos steps up the game for 2021. It will give more competition to Qualcomm in the Android world and that can only be good. I’m personally holding out till 2021 to make the upgrade to see what Samsung brings to the table. I am encouraged by the news that Google is working with Samsung on a custom chip. That means Samsung is doing something good that Google likes. 

What are your predictions for the Exynos 1000? I imagine the CPU configuration is most up for debate. Other configurations most likely include:
-1x Cortex-X1, 3x Cortex A78, 4x Cortex A55
-4x Cortex A78 (1 boosted, 3 efficient), 4x Cortex A55
-Perhaps even different “LITTLE” cores, but I don’t see that happening"
Android,"There are more than 2 million Redditor on this subreddit so how many of you don't count on their reviews? Just curiosity.

I understand your complaints about their reviews, I enjoy watching their reviews but I myself have my own complaints, their reviews aren't perfect TBH IMO no one made a complete perfect review (mentioned every little thing and aspect in a very detailed way and didn't ignore anything)

Before I watch their reviews I 100% know exactly what they gonna ignore, what they probably gonna talk about etc...

* Camera: they almost talk about everything except some things that this [guy](https://www.youtube.com/user/JuanBagnell) mention in his reviews that I really appreciate + this [guy](https://www.youtube.com/user/hendrickson)

* screen: ""vivid, sharp, bezel-less, notches, amazing, etc..."" Yeah but [this is how you review a smartphone screen](https://youtu.be/-RMtIjVXAl4), learn from him + ok, TBF this is a professional calibrator so no surprises but also instead of hiring more people or spending more money just to level up the production quality, try hiring or collaborating with professionals like him to make your videos more informative and richer.

* gaming: ""amazing performance"", no correct and accurate gaming test, no thermal throttling test, no battery drain info, etc... Just "" smooth gaming experience"", except GSMArena, go check their review of the [Red magic 5G](https://m.gsmarena.com/nubia_red_magic_5g-review-2092.php) and [Vivo IQOO 3](https://m.gsmarena.com/vivo_iqoo_3_5g-review-2100.php), **[ROG Phone 2](https://m.gsmarena.com/asus_rog_phone_ii_ultimate_edition-review-1984.php)**, finally some accurate* tests that I can count on, I just hope they do these test on all the phones and tablets they review not just gaming phones. (This is something that all the reviewers that I know not just the mainstream ones don't do it as good or as accurate as GSMArena)

* audio: well I just like how DXOmark test the audio, how they test each and every aspect in depth but I'm just not sure if I can trust them 100% but man the Mi 10 Pro is really good in audio except the speakers aren't front-firing but seems everyone ignores the fact that front-firing stereo speakers are going extinct (fingers crossed for the RP3) + big respect for Acer for their tablet the predator 8 **4 front-firing speakers**, audio is as important as the screen, it's half the experience.

* build quality: ""this is a premium phone, so glass back..."" I don't know about you but I prefer metal back, yeah glass is shiny and make the device looks and feels ""premium"" but glass is glass and glass can and will break, durability is just far more important than looks and gives a real value to the word ""premium"" + did you know that Huawei's latest tablet that has a **metal back support fast wireless charging**? TBF all the reviewers that I know ignore this thing not just the mainstream ones.

* why everyone ignores that smartphones are very very slow when transferring files through a USB cable? A phone uses USB 3.0 port should give me 625MB/s speed, did I get this speed? No, anyone asked why? As far as I know, it's because phones/tablets are using an old slow file transferring protocol, not like a normal external SSD/HDD/Flash drive, etc... + Phones/tablets still don't support NTFS File system so my only option is FAT32 because my smart TV doesn't support exFAT, how much exactly the cost of supporting these file systems? This is also another thing ignored by almost everyone.

** accurate: their tests are pretty accurate except that they don't mention the number of threads they choose when they do the CPU thermal throttling test so we don't know for sure if their tests are 100% accurate or not, if you tested this thing like me you will know that when you set the number of threads on 100 there will be no performance cap at all on the CPU so you will get 100% accurate results this is if the test was at least 30 minutes long (60 minutes recommended) and the device was set on maximum performance mode + normal temperature room.

You may ask, why doing a thermal throttling test? Well to know for sure if all these marketing bullshit ""liquid cooling system, vapor chamber, 3 layer something cooling, etc...) Are real or bullshit as we expect.

But also I need to say that for now we can't do a 100% accurate GPU thermal throttling test because there is no app for such a thing (you can run 3DMark sling shot extreme test multiple times and your GPU will beg for mercy like when Linus did it but still not 100% the best way) only a [CPU thermal throttling test app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=skynet.cputhrottlingtest), I hope we can test both at the same time.

So suggestions for other reviewers that I should follow?

**edit1: I will keep following and watching your reviews because I enjoy them and they are still useful**"

Android,"...but in the distance Mediatek seems to be approaching stronger than ever.

So, what do you guys think? Can Mediatek make comeback? (As if they had ever been on top hahaha)

Hopefully this ""little"" fight will bring some juicy gains to us consumers in a market reigned by Qualcomm, who may have been taking advantage of it's monopoly this year with the mandatory 5g modem on SD865s.

I predict that at least on the mid-range, Mediatek's got a shot (although I'm not quite sure they are pushing mid-range processors or high-end processors at a discounted price)"
Android,"I think it's the OS itself that is inferior and inefficient with the hardware it has access to just like any other open source software. There is a reason why apple remains a close walls, they can make a decision to improve something without having ten different people tell them why they shouldn't go ahead. They make it a standard and it gets adopted industry wide including in the open source community because well, apple did it and people don't seem to care about a flaw that androids would be under the scanner for. Google really should make fuschia close source and release it only in their devices"
Android,"**This is my own opinion so feel free to disagree + This post is just for sharing my opinion nothing more**

I have a Galaxy Note 9 Exynos (I should have chosen the ROG Phone when I had the chance)

Every day every single time I grab my phone I just feel a little bit sad (sometimes angry) because I know for a fact that the hardware this phone has can offer me more, I know this phone and every phone out there have hardware that has the power to do more things and do the things that it's already doing a lot better but the software is always holding back the hardware capabilities.

we are in 2020, smartphones have improved a lot over the last decade in term of hardware but yet the software isn't keeping up with the hardware, smartphones have a lot of potential but still, we won't get the chance to take the advantage of this hardware because of the software.

Let me explain more by using 3 phones as an example OP, ROG Phone, Galaxy Note series, I will talk specifically about the SoC (SD865) inside these phones (I will ignore the camera because we all know that we can get better shots out of these cameras if the software was better):

As I said we are in 2020, just look at the benchmark results of these phones, what do you think these phones are capable of doing? Don't you think with great software optimizations and utilization they can handle some intensive tasks that we normally do on PCs or laptops or even gaming consoles?

With desktop mode becoming a thing don't you think these phones can handle the full office apps? Some advanced video editing apps, the full adobe photoshop? Etc...

Just by looking at the benchmarks (3Dmark sling shot extreme benchmark), you will notice that 2020 phones are pretty close to the iPad Pro when it comes to GPU power the same iPad that apple described it as powerful as the Xbox 1S, so can't these phones handle some serious productivity and gaming tasks? Not just some MS office dogshit clones and candy crush?

16GB RAM, 1TB internal storage, 144Hz displays, etc... with just 3 years of software updates and companies making it harder to flash custom ROMs by locking the bootloader and prevent you from using a lot of features the phone has by doing so... Even the only justifiable argument right now which is making the device more future proof by adding all these specs is becoming weaker and weaker every year.

With developers and software companies support + monitor and keyboard and mouse phones can and will replace laptops/PC for a lot of people including me.

Phones have the potential to be the smartphone and the laptop and the PC and gaming console for many people, and this also would mean saving a lot of money.

But sadly I don't see manufacturers going to utilize this hardware anytime soon and maybe never + I know why they won't do it.

Edit: reality is often disappointing."
Android,"Take a look at XDA's description of MIUI privacy features: 

MIUI 12 brings many new security features, making it a great solution for privacy-conscious users. Like we mentioned above, Xiaomi is not simply adding these new privacy features but also taking the effort of making them visually attractive. Besides making the privacy-related information easy to consume, MIUI 12 also makes this information easy to consume by simplifying how privacy-related permissions are grouped. As compared to stock Android, the information is present much more refreshing, illustrative, and intriguing.

MIUI 12 offers a comprehensive overview of the permission being used by different apps by using clear text and description under each permission. Compared to stock Android, the privacy data represented in MIUI 12 is easier to understand and less intimidating to the users.  In addition, MIUI 12 also allows users to control permissions for actions like the state of NFC connection and the ability of apps to show permanent notifications or as pop-up windows.

Nowadays, as peple's privacy becomes a more and more important topic, what could OS or phones do to protect user's privacy?"

Android,"Greetings and good day to you, hope you're staying safe :)


Straight to the point, if you're having issues with your notifications arriving late or even not arriving at all on Android Q (10) the issue appears to be the new default ""Adaptive Notifications"" that Google introduced and made it the new default option, strangely. 

It is essentially a way for Google to automatically manage your notifications, using AI. And that is what messing up the notifications and how they work. 

Turning this off basically let the notifications work as before, in normal behavior, no delays, no priority, no nothing. The way it should be. 


To turn it off, basically go to :

 Settings -> Apps -> 3 Dots Menu -> Special Access -> Adaptive Notifications -> Set it to None


Or you can just search ""Adaptive Notifications"" in your settings' main screen and you'll jump there. 

(on Samsung phones, it's known that any Power Mode other than High Performance will cause some delays to save battery, so keep that in mind)

Restart your phone after doing this, then check on it again to make sure it's set to None. 

You should receive your notifications instantly now, I was having issues with Google Reminders and Gmail and several other apps' notifications but it appears that this AI stuff is what causing it. 

Good luck and hopefully it'll work out for you just like it did to me :)"
Android,"I just am just baffled how the whole world is brainwashed into thinking they need the flagships, the fastest CPU, and UFS 3.0 and LPDDR5 in a fucking mobile device.   


One argument people give is about the features and experience of a flagship. Well, all those features can be provided on a phone with mid-range specs too, they are not tied to faster CPU and RAM, it's just that companies choose not to do so for obvious reasons.  


Another argument can be about 4k/8k photography - Well mid-range can handle 4k easily and 8k is of no use at present and won't be for the general public for a long long time. It takes hell lot of storage and there are many other constraints to it other than the phone's capability itself. So my point is if you gonna do 8k, the smartphone is not the right tool to do it. Just suppose if smartphones were as powerful as desktops would you be doing 3d rendering on a phone? Hell no.  


Another argument, gaming. Again, advances in mobile gaming are pointless beyond a certain point. If you were to experience hight FPS, photo-realistic gaming, you would do that on a PC or console not a 6-7 inch mobile device. And suppose even if that wasn't a factor, still, no one will develop a game that needs top-end specs, there is zero incentive to do so. Mobile gaming is a mass market, not an enthusiast thing. This principle stretches to every other aspect of a mobile platform. The mid-low range is always going to be the focus of any possible application or feature.   


Hence it is proved that flagships will remain pointless even in the future and centuries to come. They will remain just a flaunt."
Android,"I'm completely blown away by this device. I wish I remember when I even used it. Barely any apps were on it. I remember vividly using the 5 and 6 but what did I even upgrade to after this phone? 

I don't recall Android 8 either. My daily driver is a Pixel 3 but damn does this phone feel good. I can't help but feel every time I touch a nexus device I'm reminded how dominant Google used to be with aesthetic. 


I feel a lot less satisfied holding my pixel 3 than this. Maybe because it's just a change of scenery. IDK.

Android,"At 1:30 this morning (5-23) many Chinese users found that their Samsung phones including Galaxy  S8,S9, S10 and S20,.etc broken. It's inferred that a local time/calendar software bug resulted in this.

Applehelp,"Hello there,

I would like to answer some common and basic FAQ regarding Apple Store re-openings during COVID19

Please don’t hesitate to ask more questions below which I will endeavour to answer and update the post.

&#x200B;

**There is an Apple store open near me, Can I go there?**

The availability of open Apple stores will be updated on the website, however if it is not a confirmed hardware fault with your device you could be encouraged to contact Apple Care.

&#x200B;

**What type of appointments are the open Apple Stores taking?**

They can only facilitate hardware issues and Apple Online Orders currently.

&#x200B;

**I paid for something on the Apple Online Store, Can I pick it up at the Apple Store?**

Yes! Of course you can. Please follow the advise you may have been given by email, you will be subjected to a temperature check on entry of the store and a mask will be required. If you do not have one, the Store may supply one buy please do not rely on them providing one due to stock levels.

&#x200B;

**What is my Apple Store doing to protect me?**

The Apple Stores which are eligible to open have integrated systems to check your temperature before you enter the store as well as requiring masks for entry. If you do not have a mask, the Apple Store may supply one. Please do not rely on the store supplying a mask due to inventory levels.

&#x200B;

**I cant book an appointment online for the Apple store! Can I just walk in?**

Unfortunately, due to the high demand of the stores, you can understand that the appointments available are booking out quite fast. Please be patient, they are doing their best. If you do decide to walk in, you will be turned away due to your governments restrictions. Please try to contact Apple Care first.

&#x200B;

**I do not consent to my temperature being checked.**

Unfortunately the Apple stores are only following the government regulations and restrictions implemented, but we are looking after your safety and other customers safety. If you do not consent that is totally okay, however you may not be allowed entry.

&#x200B;

**What are my other options? If I dont go to an Apple Store?**

Well, we do have quite a few options depending on your issue and device! There are Apple Authorised Service providers which are just as equivalent to an Apple store. We also have a few Mail in options available through Apple Care too.

&#x200B;

**What exactly can Apple Care do?**

Apple Care is our phone/chat support which can do just as much as an Apple store! They can solve 80% of the issues you encounter. They also can provide you with estimates of cost with hardware issues. (Please note; Hardware costs are only an estimate, depending on the inspection done by an Apple Employee in person)

&#x200B;

**Where can I find more official information regarding Apples procedures during COVID19?**

You can find it at [here](https://www.apple.com/shop/browse/store/temporary\_closures)"
Applehelp,"Earlier this year I purchased a “Remove ads forever” upgrade to an iOS app, but about a month later I updated the app and the ads came back. The restore purchases option does not work. Apple says there is nothing they can do and I must take it up with the app developer. Unfortunately, the contact form on their website doesn’t work (won’t submit) and they have ignored my emails. Is there anything I can do? I expected that Apple would either force the developer to honor the purchase or give me a refund, but they say no.

Applehelp,"I decided it would be better to upload a video describing the issue in a little more detail to YouTube. Uploading directly to Reddit was a little slower than usual...

**TL;DR: Late 2008 MacBook Pro 15"" is making some weird noises when powering on and opening the lid. I think one of the sounds is the DVD Drive checking for a boot disc but I'm not sure. The other one is very intriguing. It sounds like a muffled ""click"". I've never heard of anything quite like this. It only happens when the machine is turned on. Opening the lid with it off does not trigger the sound.**

Here is the video:

[https://youtu.be/s0S-TK8rMWg](https://youtu.be/s0S-TK8rMWg)

In it, you can hear them pretty clearly (Headphones recommended. Please excuse my pijamas and messy room)... I think this ""click"" sound was happening with less frequency some time ago. I first thought it could be a bizarre consequence to the notorious heat it sometimes run on, but it isn't. I heard it when it was cooler. Then I thought it could be a problem with the display hinge. I'm not very familiar with fixing the display assembly, but the fact that I could not hear the click every time I moved the display made me question this possibility. Not only but as you can see in the video, I opened the laptop, turned on and then heard the noise.  This makes me believe it might be a power issue or maybe it's a very peculiar sounding HDD noise.

I've never had any MacBook prior to this one. I'm not quite sure on how firm the hinge should feel. Right now, it holds the position of the display on every normal usage situation I tried so far. The movement feels fairly sturdy, not being too harsh and also being easy to open/close it. It is possible to move the display if the laptop is shaken rather forcefully.

The noise happens about every 8/10 times when opening the lid on sleep mode and booting.

I think I should mention one more thing... This laptop never had **any** part of it upgraded since 2008. The battery is still the same (performs about as well as you'd expect :/ ) the Hard Drive is the same from factory. It all was the standard parts up until I upgraded one of the 2GB DDR3 RAM sticks to a 4GB DDR3, totalling 6GB of system memory.

Reading from ""About this Mac"":

MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2008)

Processor: 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo

Memory: 6 GB 1067 MHZ DDR3

I currently own an aging 2012 Macbook Air 1.8ghz i5 4gb ram. I've upgraded it to a 1TB SSD a while and did a fresh install of Catalina today in hopes that it can breathe new life to it. Unfortunately its still slow, even sometimes having a hard time with just web browsing. I thought about upgrading it to a new 2.0ghz i7 logic board with 8gb of ram but that will also cost $300

I can sell it this laptop for $400 CAD and buy a 2012 Macbook pro 2.9ghz i7 with 8gb of ram for also $400 CAD, is it worth doing this? I figured the processor has more power and it already has more ram, the only thing I would need to upgrade is the hard drive or even add more ram.

I use it for school work, web-browsing and also cloud gaming (geforce now, shadow), I have it plugged into a monitor 99.9% of the time. 

Would this be the most cost-effective route?"

Applehelp,"I feel so lame posting this, because I see that a similar question has been posted twice in the past couple weeks. I've read the answers, and I'm wondering if what I'm seeing is normal.

2015 MBP. 500GB SSD. 

104 GB in Documents  
65 GB in Music  
51 GB in Photos  
47 GB in other users  
44 GB in Apps  
36 GB in iOS files  
11 GB in mail  
6 GB in messages  
11 GB in system  
114 GB in Other  
Total: 489GB (I have some free now)

What is this ""other""? I've used Disk Inventory X, and even downloaded the paid version of ""GrandPerspective"". I've gone through the piecemeal files, and I'm realizing that there's just nothing that adds up to that 114GB that I can tell right off. 

I found some old stuff that I deleted, but I noticed that GrandPerspective only has 186 GB listed in my home folder. I don't know where else to scan for stuff? 

Do I need to do some kind of reinstall? It's so frustrating to have what should be a ton of extra space, and here I am deleting old podcasts and movie files.

Applehelp,"I used to make a lot of music with GarageBand back in 2008-2012 but I stupidly never thought my Mac would die on me since I took care great care of it so I never made backups of my music, iTunes library , or pictures and documents. 

Those music files and pics are my high school memories and I would love to have them again but at this point it seems impossible? I recently decided to boot up my Mac to listen to some of the music but it won’t turn on. The white light on the keyboard front end that indicates it’s asleep turns on but that’s it, the actual screen stays black. I’ve tried removing the battery and booting it up but it’s the same . 

My question is, is there anyway i can take out the hard drive and move it to another computer in order to access the files? Well, is there anyway I can access those files again or will they just become lost memories of the good days? 😞

Thank you guys for any help! Just for reference it’s a black 13inch MacBook from 2008. The last time i used it and it worked was 2017 I believe but even then the battery was already dead so I had to use it plugged in to the wall outlet with the battery removed .

I figured the problem was on his end; that Apple doesn't think his # is an iPhone.  So I went thru this procedure:

I had him turn iMessage off, rebooted his iPhone, then turned iMessage back on again.  

No go; my iPhone still refuses to admit his # is an iPhone.

So now I'm not 100% sure the problem is on his phone; I guess it could be my iPhone?  But iMessage is working for everyone else I'm corresponding with.

I experienced a pretty severe and strange error recently and I'd like your thoughts on what it could have been.

For the record, I'm a graphic designer and I tend to use Adobe products regularly. Some are very system heavy (Photoshop/Illustator/After Effects)

This error did not occur while these programs were running but they had been running the during the day prior to this error.

# The error in question:

I was in an online Zoom session - **This was through the browser version of Zoom, not the downloaded app versio**n -  (it was a group meeting) and everything was functioning normally. Suddenly, my image (from my webcam) in Zoom flashed on my screen in green twice and then it cut entirely to green. Like a solid green block. The same color as green screen material.

I could still see everyone else in the meeting though I could not confirm if they saw me as the meeting ended right when this error came up.

I thought it was my webcam but I noticed the issue seemed to be related to images. What I mean is that on Facebook and on Google and on Reddit, various images were coming up as green blocks. It was like you replaced the image entirely as solid green. There was no logic to why certain images were having errors over others.

I tried this in two different web browsers (Chrome and Safari) and experienced it in both.

I ran a system Disk Utility scan on all drives in my system and they all came up as normal. I did this through the Recovery menu upon booting up.

After I did this I restarted everything and have experienced no issues since. I haven't the slightest idea what could be the issue and part of me thinks it's graphical in nature (like whatever renders images in my system is experiencing a partial error)

Has this error been experienced by anyone else and would you have any idea what might be causing it?

My iMac is only four years old so I'd be shocked if I was already experiencing a technical failure. Let me know your thoughts."
Applehelp,"So as the title says I’m thinking about buying a MacBook Pro, Air or IPad Pro for work. I manage a chain of small businesses and am looking for something to use for work. So my job doesn’t require more than basic functions, documents, spread sheets, multiple emails, social media, etc. 

I currently have an IPhone 11 Pro (as a work phone) and AirPods Pro, but I haven’t owned any Apple products besides those. I do have a full fledge gaming laptop that I just don’t want to keep lugging around to work I could always use if needed and figured an Apple mobile PC would sync well with my work iPhone. 

So the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard honestly appeals the most to me, the OS is similar to the iPhone and it’s the most different from my windows laptop. That being said I’d be looking at the base model IPad Pro 12.9 with the Magic Keyboard. The other options would be an MacAir (the second cheapest with the I5 and 512 SSD) or a MacBook Pro 13 inch base model, I would have to get used to the OS for both of these never owning a Mac before and also I’m 
not a huge Apple guy (I don’t hate them or anything my priorities have just always been gaming before this) so not sure what the difference is between the Air and Pro really besides screen size and specs. So obviously the Air and Pro have larger screens and nicer keyboards, the IPad losses out in storage (I have a Dropbox through work and most things that would take up space are docs and basic files) against both the laptops but is more portable and has multiple use modes and again is more different than what I currently have. 

I wanted to get some thoughts from people and get some suggestions! Any advice/opinions would be great I can also provide more info if needed."

Applehelp,"Hello /r/applehelp! I'll give a brief rundown of my situation, use case, and data about the machine, and hopefully this ends up being a relatively easy fix.  

I recently began making the move from the Windows and Android life into the Apple ecosystem, beginning with the iPhone 11 Pro, AirPods Pro, and a 2017 10.5 iPad Pro. The next step will hopefully be the laptop. 

My wife has a Mid-2012 Macbook Air (Core i5, 4 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) that she used through college but has used hardly at all over the past 4-5 years. She works mainly on a Chromebook now, and we would either rehab (for my use), sell, or donate this MBA. Eventually I would like to target a used MacBook Pro, perhaps a 2015 with at least 8 GB of RAM but potentially 16 for the right price. 

In any case, this mid-2012 Macbook Air is in good physical shape but has a few challenges.  

1. The battery has a cycle count of 685 and the ""service battery"" note. Looking at the price and the process for doing a battery replacement manually, I am comfortable taking that leap, but only if the investment is worth it provided I can overcome the other two hurdles.  

2. The unit has not kept up with updates. It's currently on Mac OS 10.8.5, and when attempting to update to Catalina or El Capitan through the App Store, it tells me that this update ""requires Mac OS 10.9 or later"". I seem to have no way to update to 10.9. So my two questions related to this point - How do I go about updating this to a clean, usable install of a newer version of Mac OS? Given the specs of this machine, is Catalina too resource heavy to work well?  

3. The elephant in the room. 4 GB of RAM. I'll share my use case below, but if you feel straight away that this machine is simply underpowered and incapable of accomplishing those tasks in my workflow, I will forego the battery replacement, try to do a clean install, and sell the machine at a fair price while saving for something a little more capable.  

**Use Case:** The iPhone and iPad Pro mentioned in the top paragraph will cover 90%+ of my use case - media consumption, social media, ebooks, general browsing, email (Gmail for personal and Outlook for work). The laptop would serve for those tasks that simply work better with a full keyboard layout - longer emails, occasionally using it to remote in to a browser-based CRM system for work, the occasional Excel document, doing bills/financial stuff, and having desktop OS access to the things from the Apple ecosystem (Messages, AirDrop, Notes, etc.). I do no photo/video editing, production, gaming, or really any resource-intensive tasks, and this MBA or future Mac laptop would account for 10-15% of my total workflow.  

That brings me to the technical aspect of my question... if you feel an 8 year old MBA with 4 GB of RAM can serve those needs, I am requesting help with point #2 regarding *which* Mac OS version to install and *how* to properly install it coming from 10.8.5. If that is successful, I may be back for any challenges regarding the DIY battery install. Please let me know if I need to clarify anything above, and I appreciate your guidance in advance!"

Applehelp,"I've recently bought a drawing tablet to use with my Macbook Pro mid-2014. However, something is screwy with Mac's drivers. I have read this is an issue for some users using drawing tablets.

.

When I plug in the tablet it becomes an extended desktop. I also have it set as a separate space. I can use the tablet with the pen, the trackpad or a mouse fine. Everything works. Clicks, drags, text highlighting, gestures and etc all work. (Note: Setting extended desktop as the same space does not change my issue)

.

If I unplug the tablet, any windows that were on it move up to the the laptop's screen and everything works the same. Unplugging the tablet and plugging it back in has no affect on performance. 

.

However, if the Macbook goes to sleep while the tablet is plugged in, upon wake-up the cursor (whether using the trackpad or a mouse) become erratic. Unplugging and replugging in the tablet does not fix it either. Only a full system reboot will fix it.

**SYMPTOMS:**

* **1.** Dragging windows is not animated.
* **2.** Can not select program windows from three finger gesture menu
* **3.** Can not highlight text
* **4.** Can not click and drag window sliders
* **5.** Can not resize windows
* **6.** If window is full screen, bringing the cursor up to the top of the screen will not reveal window options.
* **7.** Attempting to drag highlighted text causes it to zoom off screen rapidly.
* **8.** Sometimes cursor is frozen in top left corner.
* **9.** Two finger scroll still works.
* **10.** Right Click menu disappears a moment after being pressed.

If I plug in the tablet, I can still use it normally. If I mirror displays, normal cursor functionality only works on the tablet when using the pen."

Applehelp,"Hello,

Yesterday, I decided to give my dad my iPad Pro 11”. I reset all content and settings, and set it up as a brand new iPad running iPadOS 13.5. I logged in with his Apple ID and enabled iMessage in iCloud so his messages are identical on his iPhone 11 (iOS 13.5) and his new iPad Pro 11”. Shortly after enabling it, I noticed iMessage search index was stuck with contact photos as placeholders for links and there isn’t the usual heading for attachments, photos, and locations. Also, the verbiage advising indexing happening is not there [SCREENSHOT](https://imgur.com/a/vH50eBn). It has been over 24 hours with no change, and messages received after the iPad are populating their photos, links, etc. perfectly fine. I believe it’s an indexing issue. 

The other strange issue is that some contact photos appear zoomed out to the top left of the circle [SCREENSHOT](https://imgur.com/a/GcvQZk2). They appear normal on his iPhone. As you can see from the screenshot, other contact photos aren’t affected.

I had these issues earlier this year on my own iPhone and iPad. The only solution was to set them both up as new devices, with my iPad needing more than one restore to index properly. I really don’t want to go through that again. Unfortunately, Apple Support have not been much help.

Does anyone have a solution or know how to force the device to re-index messages? Please help.

Applehelp,"Hi!

I have a Philips 272E external monitor connected via DisplayPort to my 2016 MBP. This works well except after the display goes to sleep. Approximately 50 percent of the time the external monitor doesn't wake up. The MPB senses the connection. I say that because the MPB monitor will go on and off like when you first plug in an external display. The external display gives these two messages in order: ""No video input"" then ""Enter sleep mode."" If I unplug the cable from the MBP the external monitor goes into a floating message of ""Check cable connection.""

I'm running 10.15.4, always connected to power.

I've tried turning the power off to the monitor, then turning it back on. UNSUCCESSFUL

I've tried unplugging the DP cable from the MPB and plugging it back in. UNSUCCESSFUL

I've tried unplugging the DP cable from the external monitor and plugging it back in. UNSUCCESSFUL

I don't have another cable to try. This cable is new (I know that's no guarantee of function). I was connected previously with a miniDP-HDMI adapter, but that adapter broke, which let me to purchase the ""new"" cable.

So far the only way to get the monitor back is by rebooting. Hoping someone here knows something that can help."

I have had this device for a few months (bought second hand) and it has worked perfectly until a few days ago. I had the device plugged in and was using it and suddenly it stopped charging. I checked the charger and the block and even tried other cable and tested them on other devices; they worked on the other devices. However, the ipad would not charge. I restarted it a few time and eventually managed to get it to charge again. Yesterday however, it did this again and I haven't been able to restart it I have tried different blocks, cords and I have restarted and hard reset the device to no avail. I even tried to reset all of the settings to default. (And I did check the port and cleaned it out).

Applehelp,"Hello everyone, 

I have a 2020 MacBook Air I bought last month. 256GB storage, upgraded 16GB RAM. Fully updated with Catalina 10.15.4.

Long story short, after about a week of use, I noticed that there were times where, despite only running a few apps (usually iMessage, Mail, and Chrome, which I know is a hog, but still) the laptop would have a lot of trouble launching even the most basic apps, such as Notes or even System Preferences. I also run into this frequently when trying to open some very basic files on Preview such as a 1 or 2 page PDF. A lot of times this seems to happen with a snowball effect for a bit, and then I'll reset it or something like that and it'll be fine again for the time being. However, it always comes back within a day or so.

I contacted Apple Support who walked me through some very basic steps, including reinstalling the OS, reinstalling the OS and starting fresh by completely wiping the hard drive, and a few others. Finally, they had me send it in for repair. The repair guys couldn't replicate the issue, despite me sending videos in. Finally, they sent it back with a replaced Logic Board.

Well, I have the MacBook, and it started doing it again. I know I'm running apps and this not the Pro, including Chrome, but I still feel like it is unreasonable for any MacBook to be doing this.

See this video I've attached - this particular instance was earlier today, but it's basically the same thing every time. Sometimes longer.

https://youtu.be/gfZsEgAHpmw


Has anyone ever seen this happen? If so, what was it? Obviously things are a bit crazy with the pandemic, but I am frustrated by Apple Support seeming to have no idea what it is or how to fix it. I wonder if they'll have to give me a new laptop or something.

Thank you for any help."

Applehelp,"So I purchased a new MacBook 2020 recently for my video editing work; which turned out to be more fortunate than on first thought as a matter of weeks later my trusty 2012 machine received a very light ‘shower’ of water from a spilled drink. 
After cleaning up the small deluge, It initially didn’t seem phased by its delicate washing and continued to operate on the video call we were on (obviously, it’s Covid time.) Then, The call started to blink. Still on the line, but the screen cutting out for a few milliseconds at a time. I lifted it up to just try and get a better look underneath or whatever and as I placed it back down the screen had a flash of colours and lines and blacked out. Then came back. We ended the call and shut down the computer and it wouldn’t come back on. Queue Small electrical burning smell. Was definitely worried at this point. 

Decided to let it dry out somewhat and open the back up. No real signs of damage and left it to air a couple days. Today, I took it apart properly, removed the logic board and battery. Cleaned it up properly, spotted a few spots of corrosion but honestly not really that severe or terminal looking, so cleaned them up and reattached everything. 
Reassembled, breath held. Nothing. Well initially, but it then crept to life. But no matter what I did the screen has remained resolutely black since. I’ve checked and the computer itself definitely seems operational, the backlit keyboard illuminates, the speakers sound and when connected to an external display (TV) it has displayed an apple background. But no matter what, have had no luck getting it’s own display to work. 

Quick fire checklist:
Have reset the NVRAM/PRAM
Have reset the SMC
Have done a series of hard shutdowns and reboots
Have tried to trick it into sleeping and rebooting and
Have tried the trick of entering your password and entering anyway. 

Still not booting up the screen and pressing enter does nothing but make a sound. 

So any suggestions of what may be causing this or potential fixes would be welcomed as all apple stores here (UK) remain closed and I don’t exactly trust them anyway... 

Thanks x"

Applehelp,"Hey all,

When I purchased my MacBook (Pro w/touch bar) at Best Buy it came with Kaspersky Internet Security software. I thought this was a little silly but for some unknown reason I went ahead and installed it. The program itself did nothing other than cause headaches. I went through to the app and uninstalled it, and figured that was the end of it. Less than a week later it was trying to reinstall itself. I've searched through my computer and deleted everything that I can find that seems related, but even now (admittedly a couple of years later--it just finally occurred to me to ask Reddit; I've come up empty-handed searching for the solution on my own) the icon is still in the menu bar/status menu and every now and then I still get pop ups asking me to update. 

I'm at a loss for what I can do to remove this crap, especially considering that the program was federally banned at the end of 2017 due to its [ties with Russian intelligence and military officials](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-19/cybersecurity-kaspersky-has-close-ties-to-russian-spies) and some weird link to the Russian involvement in the last presidential election[^(1)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-kaspersky/trump-signs-into-law-u-s-government-ban-on-kaspersky-lab-software-idUSKBN1E62V4) [^(2)](https://fortune.com/2017/09/13/kaspersky-lab-ban-dhs-trump/). I couldn't believe the accusations/ban when I first saw them, and I'm really, really eager to get this junk off of my computer. I feel pretty stupid for having installed it in the first place.

Applehelp,"Hi everyone,

It's my first post here and I'm french, so excuse me in advance if my english isn't perfect. Also, I'm not an expert in computers so try not being rude for nothing.

I've searched the internet for about 3 days now and I havent found any solution to my problem so here it is:

I wanted to upgrade the internal HHD of my computer for an SSD drive cuz among other things, my workflow in Logic Pro X is, well, not good at all. I would had upgrade the RAM at the same time but I just discovered that I bought the only Imac (Late 2015 21.5') where they used to weld the RAM so there is nothing to do with it. Frustrating. I then found risky, pricey and complicated to open my mac knowing that the only thing I could do is upgrade my drive.

So, I found on the internet that it was possible to instal the OS on an external SSD and run it exactly as it was on the internal drive. I found that solution very appealing so I started doing research about external SSD, the speed I could get vs the internal drive, etc. Knowing that I cannot upgrade my 8 gig RAM computer, at least, I'd like to get the maximum speed I can from my new hypothetic drive.

Most of the cheapest and most popular SSDs turn around \~550 Mo/s and others can go way faster with USB 3.1, 3.2 or thunderbolt 3. I only have USB 3.0 ports on my computer that cannot go higher than 5 Gbps so I thought I could use one of my two thunderbolts 2 ports that never served me in 4 years, that way I could save my USB 3 ports (that are always full with hardwares that needs the full potential of usb 3) and run my new SSD at full speed.

The problem is that I found no SSD with thunderbolt 2 connections and the thunderbolt 3 ones are incompatible with thunderbolt 2 even with an adapter.

I've red a similar post with the same concern, but I'm asking the question again: Is there a way to plug an SSD in a thunderbolt 2 port with a special adapter or with a bypass trick like SATA to Thunderbolt or I dont know. Is there an old SSD that used a thunderbolt 2 connection that I could find on the used market?

If none of the above have a satisfying answer, will an SSD connected to a USB 3.0 have a transfert rate up to 5 Gbps or will it be less than that? Is it worth it then?

Is a USB hub a viable solution to split signals for demanding pieces of hardwares like a hard drive, a sound card and a midi keyboard (powered via usb). I dont think so, but I'm asking. I also have a mouse that clearly could go with one of the other so maybe I could have one free slot. A good usb hub in mind?

Anyway, sorry for the loooong story, but I wanted to be sure my needs were well understood.

Thanks in advance for your answers! :)"
Applehelp,So I tried backing up an iPad to a Mac for my cousin because he was thinking about getting an iPod.

Screen time features sync across all his devices and I have to constantly allow things on the computer for him to do his homework. He uses far too many features on the computer for me to granularly create allowances for him to do his work effectively so I want to just exclude the computer from screen time controls as he generally only uses the computer for school work or other approved activities.

However, the only way I've found to do that is to turn off screen time as a Family iCloud parent control, and enable it manually on the device I want to manage. Therefore, on the occasion where I want to approve more time I have to manually put in the pass code as opposed to him just being able to send me a request via one of my devices.

Does anyone know of a way to exclude a device from Parental Control managed Screen Time without just signing out of the kid's Apple ID on the device?"

Hello all. Years back, when I was about 12, I got my first mp3 player for my birthday. I've since lost it, but I'd like to find the model and buy it again for sentimental reasons. I've attached a paint image of what I sort of remember how it looks. 

Its small, silver, and has a blue LED screen. It also has a push-out USB stick. The slider is located on the back of the player above the battery compartment. 

I haven't been able to find any similar model online - I think it may be from china.

One specific response from an account really creeped me out so much so that I'm gonna get rid if this account. Throwaway account mentioned specific places relevant to where I know reside.

EDIT: I started digging through my accounts and found a cell phone logged into my account on May 1. I got the IP address and approximate location of where the log in occurred. I looked it up on Google and it's a small hole in the wall restaurant I visited ages ago, I recognized the place cause it was where I had an interaction that was quite memorable. Delicious food too.

I have already posted this to r/techsupport but I thought I would try here too. 


This has happened twice in the last few weeks. My phone will go quiet and on the volume list it will say 'in call volume' (I linked a picture of this). This happens at random times when I am using my phone for completely unrelated things. It never showed an answer screen or allowed me to hang up it just starts connecting and ends connecting when it likes. On the other side of the line you just hear normal sounds like breathing and moving. You dont hear talking, which makes me wonder if this person/bot is in the same position as me ( or if it even is something and not just a slight glitch in my phone)

Today I ran avg virus protection through my phone and it didn't pick up any malware or risks. 

This could just be nothing and me overreacting, but I still find it kind of creepy. 

Does anyone have a similar problem or any advice?

Thanks

some customers are clumsy and don't place it properly and the key falls out of the RFID reader, which does not allow a customer to end the trip and they have to ensure that they key are placed correctly on the RFID reader.

what technology can I use so that the device can automatically recognize that the key is in its proximity even if there isn't 100% contact between the key and the reader?

I have a PC I built in 2012 (updated a little bit since with a newer graphics card circa 2016).
Right now, there are two HDDs with several partitions, including the original one with Windows 7 and another one for Ubuntu 18.04. I've backed all of my important files up onto an external HDD and on Google Drive. 


I want to install a new SSD and put Windows 10 on it. 

Is there an advantage to wiping everything else? Should I start completely fresh, or would it be easier to just install Win 10 on the new SSD, and then leave the other drives alone? When I boot up, which OS will boot by default? Should I remove Windows 7? (My Windows 7 is not genuine, but I just bought Windows 10 Home retail.) I'd like to upgrade Ubuntu to the latest version and have it run from another SSD I have. (Willing to wipe my existing Ubuntu installation though, and install it anew on the SSD.) 

Current setup:

- One 1 TB HDD primarily running Windows 7
 (750 GB), with a 250 GB partition running Ubuntu 18.04

- One 750 GB HDD for extra NTFS storage

- One unused 120 GB SSD

Future setup:

- One 500 GB SSD running Windows 10

- One 120 GB SSD running Ubuntu 20.04

- existing 1 TB HDD for storage

My storage isn't packed at all (my hard drive for example has just under 50% of it's storage available) and I've been trying to delete a bunch of stuff (and even trying to uninstall applications has been slow and juttery)

Besides being generally slow, I would open a game such as League (something I've been completely fine running before) and in-game my ping (NOT my fps) goes haywire, the other day didn't have ping LESS than 400 and it generally fluctuated between 400-2000 ping (so basically unplayable) I had also tried using an ethernet cable which didn't affect it - and obviously my computer has generally been slower, so my internet isn't the problem.

A weird thing I've experienced with games in particular (I thought i'd mention because it might tell you something that doesn't click with me) - when I have found myself having issues 'running' something I have done the typical first thing you'd try - adjusting the graphics, and shockingly, It wouldn't matter if I was playing on MINIMUM graphics, or MAXIMUM graphics, it would still run the same!

TLDR; Laptop running really slow - is there any other things you can suggest would be the problem/any tests I should run to try and identify the problem?

I'm looking to buy new headphones and was specifically looking for wireless ones to use with my PC. 

Since my PC's motherboard doesn't have integrated bluetooth functionality, I was researching for ways to make bluetooth headphones to work on my PC. To my research so far, it seems like a bluetooth USB adapter would do the trick for it to act as a transmitter/receiver and therefore establish connection between my PC and the headphones.   


My question is : I was wondering if someone could confirm to me if the following two products should in theory be compatible for usability? The two products are linked below :

I said all I did was trying skip a song without looking at my phone, and didn’t notice the car in my lane until it was right in front of me. She said what she paid for/downloaded online will tell her if my phone was open and connected to the internet when I was driving. Basically my main question is if this is possible and how it is? I wasn’t on my phone today but I know I have once or twice before and she guaranteed me she would go back and look. I don’t know if this is the right place to ask but any help would be appreciated"
asktechnology,I know you can switch to safe mode when your phone is on. How do you switch when after turning on your phone. I have a htc android
asktechnology,"While trying to download a youtube video, i noticed that 720p video was smaller in size than 360p. Is this a glitch? A co-incidence? Or will watching these videos in 720p actually consume lesser data than watching in 360pm"
asktechnology,"I have a couple smart plugs and a couple smart bulbs that are not brand name. You add them to your network to control them. How likely are these cheap Chinese devices that I'm buying off Amazon likely to inject some sort of network exploit?

asktechnology," 

Hey guys,

I have a 165hz monitor I recently upgraded to, and now want to use a 60hz monitor as a second monitor. I heard in the past there were issues when doing this that the 165hz monitor would just get locked to 60hz or stuttering would happen etc. Right now I'm using just one monitor and was debating on buying a vertical monitor stand because my desk is too small to have two monitors side by side.

Is this issue still present or am I safe to do a dual monitor setup like this?"
asktechnology,"Basically the title. I'm far too addicted to my phone and would like something that can do basic stuff (calls, texts, alarms, maps etc) and also allow me to use a couple of messenger apps like whatsapp and faceboon messenger without letting me install a whole host of other apps that I'd waste time on. If anyone knows of something that would be suitable I'd really appreciate the help! Thanks!"
asktechnology,"This a question I have had for quite some time now. I have googled and searched in many places even getting the opinion of an IT technician and I have heard different things all around and I am not sure what to believe anymore. I have heard people say that it is possible and I have heard people say that it can't be done. The IT technician I spoke to said that he doubts it is possible and over the years that he has been an IT technician he has never seen this happen. On the other hand, Google and many people on forums says that it is definitely possible for this to happen however none of the people that have stated this actually have any proof that they have either seen this happen or have encountered it themselves. So I am a point where I don't know what to do so I came here looking for answers. All answers and help is appreciated and I am looking forward to having this explained to me!"
asktechnology,"So I was wondering if there is a scenario where hitting pause break would actually prevent you having to power cycle your computer?

asktechnology,"I was traveling abroad in Asia recently and met someone I had a fling with. Some red flags have popped up since we split ways on the road, but we’ve stayed in touch. My Android phone had a virus on it, at least that’s all I could make of it as my battery was draining very fast and glitchy things were happening, and I tried doing a factory reset.

One of the red flags is that my Google Maps default language shifted to this other person’s native language. I’ve since been a little creeped out that there’s stalkerware, or something similar, on my phone.

Would there be any chance that this swap to my Google Maps language and the virus (potentially actually stalkerware) would be related? I just want to know if there’s any substance to this idea as I decide on how to proceed with her and my relationship. 

I’m wiping my phone again tonight."
asktechnology,"We run a restaurant that offers services to people and companys that include food and drinks (of course), but also accommodation (beds+cabins), conference rooms and shuttle boat service. Often our customers requests multiple of our services at once, but some of our customers just need a shuttle boat from A to B from 12.30-14.00 on a requested day. 

We have multiple shuttle boats, cabins and rooms that we want to have in one system to make it easier to keep organized and offer a good service to our customers. 

Which system do you recommend? 

I would prefer a self hosted and open source system if possible."
asktechnology,Is there a reason for it to turn anticlockwise instead of clockwise? Vinyl records and CD's spin clockwise so why would cassette tapes not? It seems like the technology would work exactly the same either way. I've been wondering about this for over a year and I cant seem to find a simple answer!

buildapc,"I've had a spare Asus Strix Gtx 970 laying on my shelf, in a sealed anti static bag, for about a year or so now. Took it out of my brother's pc when I rebuilt it for him for his birthday. Decided to do a giveaway to anyone with a low end gpu to help save them money. 

Comment a number from 1-1000 and whoever guesses the number first first wins.

Please don't spam numbers, I will only take the first one if you I see your name spammed. 

Please try not to guess if your current gpu is better, trying to help out people who wanna get into PCs but have a tight budget or dying pc.

Card is 100% functional and will be given a full clean up before shipping it out.

USA ONLY cause I can't ship intentionally with my current money constraints lol."
buildapc,"My i7-10700K and Asus Z490-E was delivered!

Edit: https://pcpartpicker.com/user/goallday/saved/6rYF8d"
buildapc,Just built my 1st pc and I could not be more proud of myself! Lol. MSI 450 mobo with 32 gb 3000 mhz ram 512 m.2 ssd and the bitch turned on and started up into the bios settings! Got windows steam and blizzard installed with no issues! So stoked.
buildapc,"So I recently built a new PC, and decided to reuse a hard drive from my dad's old dell laptop. When I installed windows (To a different drive) I noticed there were a lot of weird Dell partitions along with the drives I had installed. I formatted the reused drive, and deleted the partitions. So far I haven't seen any Dell things pop up, so I think I'm good in that department. But in my windows power settings, it has options meant to save laptop's battery, like the power slider. There isn't a battery icon in the toolbar, I don't see a battery in device manager, and my PC correctly labeled itself as a desktop. Can this negatively impact my PC? Can you give me any advice on what to do or how to fix it? Thanks"
buildapc,"For the last four or five years, I've relied on my laptop for gaming and production, and starting two years ago, I was really itching to switch back to a desktop and build my own (my last one was in college). The money was unfortunately never there, and when I started looking at parts, it was right in the middle of the crypto-mining craze.

Fast forward to now, and although my laptop still does fine, I missed playing newer games. Also, I started podcasting a year ago and that was really pushing my system (it took 45 minutes to an hour to mixdown everything). I've wanted to start some more video projects, but the laptop just wasn't cutting.

So with many hours of reading on r/buildapc and r/buildapcsales, playing PC Builder Simulator (a good tool to visually see what goes where and understand what parts are compatible), and watching YouTube (lots of LTT, GamerNexus and BitWit), I felt very confident in picking out my parts and building everything - I even helped my co-host with picking out parts for her new PC and she couldn't be happier! (Well, she could, if she had more RGB)

Thanks to me getting a new job, my wife and I having a stable income during this weird time, and my stimulus check, I was finally able to build a new PC! And shockingly, from scouring on r/hardwareswap and eBay, I was able to build my dream PC within my budget!

So without further ado, I give you: [The Black & Blue Machine](https://imgur.com/a/6C3fOsg) | [PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/rjhtYH)

buildapc,"This is my first time building a pc, and I'm a fat noob. The power supply I got was the thermal take smart series 600W. I'm  currently watching a video on how to put all the parts together and the guys power supply has cords that you need to plug in on your own. My power supply has like 6 cords already plugged in. Do I just ignore the cables I don't need?what do all the cords do?

buildapc,"Well after telling myself I don't need the best stuff for 15 years I've decided to spend real money and go ""all out"". I want to crush Microsoft Flight Sim when it comes out later this year. (Best guess is Thanksgiving).

I know I should wait. New stuff is coming? But I'm so confused about what is coming and when it's coming. Now that I'm down the hardware rabbithole I just wanna build it now! If I build in October instead of June, what level of better performance can I expect at 2k budget?

\^ That's my main question. I have two other minor ones if no one minds.

1. How do I build a quiet PC? Can you have no fans at all and just cool via other means?
2. So no one puts in DVD/Bluray players anymore? Why is that? I like slapping in a CD from a collection or the library. Do you all have external players? Or am I just old and a dinosaur and you all don't have collections, you just stream? :D Thanks.

p.s. #3. ""Back in my day"" Black Friday sales were a huge thing for pc parts. Is that still a thing?"
buildapc,Optiplex builds are the new meta. It's gotten to the point where and Minitower is selling almost $100 more than it's worth. What is a good alternative when it comes to upgrading prebuits?
buildapc,"Hey guys, built my computer a couple years ago after the release of the ryzen CPUs, since then some of my hardware could use a touch up, the mobo especially. I'm looking to bring my computer up one theoretical tier in it's gaming capabilities if possible. The problem with the motherboard is that I purchased the b350 tomahawk, which seems to be bottom of the line with the newer motherboards. It has issues with running my RAM at its potential speed, locking it to around 2800MHz or less, otherwise my computer crashes randomly. This has been an issue for years, even with bios updates, so its been locked under 3k for that long.

The current pc is built with the following:  
B350 Tomahawk AM4 Motherboard (Urgent replacement)  
Corsair lpx vengeance 16GB(2x8GB) 3200x  
MSI Geforce GTX 1060 6GB  
EVGANEX650G  
Ryzen 5 1500x  
PHANTEKS ENTHOO PRO M Tempered glass

Running a 1080p 144hz monitor

I have a 1TB HDD and a 500GB SSD in here as well, with cooling being provided through 120mm and 140mm fans throughout.

&#x200B;

I primarily play rust, and would like my streaming experience playing rust to impact the frames a little less, as well as my general experience playing the game being more smooth.

I was looking into going current gen, but if a simple upgrade to say, a 1080 or new cpu, with a new motherboard would do a lot for my pc as it stands, I'd like to know that, as I'm in no way a professional on the ratio of price to performance for pcs. Thanks a lot!"
buildapc,"Im in love with this case 

https://www.newegg.com/silver-streacom-db4-mini-itx-media-center-htpc-case/p/2AM-005T-00009?Item=9SIA5FYB8K6767

What components would you put in it if price didnt matter??"
buildapc,"So back in 2017 I had been saving up for a ""high end"" budget PC. It has a 1050 and a G4600 with 8GB RAM. Back then I was completely amazed by how powerful it was, since I had been stuck with shitty refurbished DELL computers all my life. Come to Christmas time in 2017 and I finally had all the parts to build it. It was the best Christmas ever.


Eventually I wanted to get a 2nd monitor but unfortunately the GPU I had bought only had 1 HDMI port, so around mid 2018 I bought a new one with 2 ports and that was my first upgrade. My second upgrade was in early 2019 where I had bought another 8GB of RAM. This was the best decision I've ever made as I was finally able to play For Honor at a constant 50-60fps.


Coming up to today I am sick and tired of this slow piece of crap and I've had enough of it. I just recently got my first ever job that's got me earning around £1k a month. With this newfound income I came up with the idea to get a new PC. At first I was thinking about upgrading the CPU to an i5 something and the GPU to a 1080ti but then I thought ""I'm making this much money, why not just save up for a few months to get something much more worth-while?"". So I loaded up my old friend PC Part Picker and started picking out some stuff. 3 years ago I would've made this list as a joke, trying to get the highest prices, but now it's possible and I never would've thought so.


Anyways, enough talking, here's my planned build:

So usually I wouldn't go with an AMD CPU but I remember seeing a post on Reddit and someone mentioned that AMD has gotten a lot better recently so I thought I'd get that.


GPU of course you gotta get the 2080, maybe one day I'll even get a 2nd one, depends how it'll hold in 10 years time.


32GB RAM is plenty to last me a few years until 32GB becomes the norm for gaming.


All the rest is pretty boring stuff you don't wanna hear about. Decided to give the whole thing the gay pride treatment. Sorry for the long story at the beginning, and if it seemed like I'm bragging, I'm just super excited and wanted to share this with you all. Also, thank you to this whole sub for being where I learn everything about building computers, you've been a huge help. Peace!"
buildapc,"Hello, I've decided to build my own PC this time since I got ""scammed"" after buying a pre-built one before, so I was hoping to get some help regarding my CPU and Mobo choices please. My main goal is a PC that will last me 4-5 years, running most games at high settings + stable VR support at 1080p for the next 2-3 years, only after that will I look into 1440p. 

All of my parts are pretty much good to go, but I keep seeing mixed posts about the i7-10700K. Some are saying it's better to get the I5-10600k instead because it's just as good and others are saying it's better to get i7-9700k instead. I was initially going to buy a i7-9700k no questions asked but the 10th gen has more threads and a higher base clock speed. So I was thinking it'll be better for my multitasking and gaming, since I have a lot of applications and tabs open a lot of the time. Plus it has hyperthreading now so it may be better for the future. I looked into AMD CPU's too but I'm not too interested in them since I want a high-end future proof PC this time, so I don't want to cheap out too much by getting an AMD CPU. Although I don't want to overpay either and buy an i9-9900k.

On the topic of motherboards, I have no idea what to look for, for a high quality motherboard. I want a lot of USB slots so I always look for that but I'm clueless otherwise on how to read Mobo specs and distinguish quality.

Any other feedback is welcome. Thanks a lot for reading, I would greatly appreciate any help!

buildapc,"I want to upgrade my PC with a new motherboard and CPU.Currently I have an Intel i5 3570K and would like to switch to an AMD CPU, since this CPU seems to struggle by now.

It seems the new 4000 series will launch towards the end of 2020.Do you think it will be worth the wait? I'd love to see a price drop in the current series, as I'm thinking about buying a Ryzen 7 3800X.

I use my PC for gaming. My GPU is a RTX 2070. Would I profit from a CPU of the new 4000 series or should the 3800X be enough?

&#x200B;

\-- **Thread Summary** \--

I'm overwhelmed by the amount of responses and discussion. This is a great sub, thanks a lot.  
I will try to summarize the general consensus here, since a lot of people seem to be in a similar situation. - Feel free to add any thoughts in the comments, I'm by no means an expert, so please refer to the comments if unsure.

\-- **CPU** \--  
\- With both, a possible 3000XT Series and the 4000 Series around the corner, waiting might be well worth it. Depending on their performance they could be worth the investment, but we'll have to see upon release.  
\- Cheap temporary upgrades like the 3100X/3300X could be used right away to bridge the waiting time.  
\- Keeping my i5 until the 4000 Series is released and the 3000 Series gets a drop in price, the 3600X becomes a good option to use until 4000 Series drops in price. (I will likely choose this path)

\-- **Motherboard** \--  
\- As with the CPU, waiting for the 550 series might be worth it financially.  
\- Many suggest the B450, though people state that gen4 support is uncertain.  
\- Others say the x570 is the way to go.  
\- I will most likely wait to see which boards will be gen4 compatible."
buildapc,I know this isn't really related to anything regarding PC building but is it safe to put a fan the size of a Desktop next to one? I'm not cooling the PC with it but I'm using it to cool myself because of the heat. Both are on top of a desk if that's important.

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

I finished building my PC yesterday, on May 26 2020. Basically, I noticed that after a little while my mouse will freeze, and my audio on discord and everything will freeze, and my friends won't be able to hear me talk, and then my monitor says no display and then all my peripherals turn off and then my PC reboots.

This happens like every 20-30 minutes.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Have reinstalled and factory reset AMD Radeon software settings and drivers for GPU. Played around with Windows Performance Settings and changed things for high peformance. 

**Post relevant photos of build/parts here.**

Idk if this is necessary for this issue

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I saw online that one potential issue for this is my BIOS for my ASRock b450M Pro4 motherboard may need updating. Can anyone please help me out with this issue it's breaking my heart to have this error and to be getting a BSOD on a brand new PC that I waited years to finally spend a lot of money on and to build"
buildapc,"So yesterday i noticed that my RAM isn't running at it's fullest potential, so some of you told me to enable XMP in bios which i did and now PC is stuck in the bios loading screen [picture](http://imgur.com/a/n72or2h) I tried resetting cmos multiple times, didn't work. I tried to reset the PC/reinstall windows from the troubleshooting menu, it crashed halfway through and said :( your pc ran into a problem and needs to restart. on restart it got stuck in that loading screen again. I don't know what to do now, i wish i'd never enabled XMP. The motherboard (Gigabyte aorus x570 elite) supports DDR4 3200, as far as i read and my ram is on the supported vendors list (Corsair venegeance lxp 2x8GB DDR4-3200). Any help is highly appreciated. This was my first PC built and I built it in February."

The cables currently go to the right, but I noticed a gap between the motherboard and graphics card. I was thinking of routing them that way, since they would have less exposure from the front. Is this safe too do? They would be pressed up against one of the chips on the MB. I haven’t found any documentation of people doing it this way. Thanks!"

I reapplied thermal paste a few days ago so cooling shouldn't be a problem. I overclocked my RAM in bios to 3200Mhz, again shouldn't be a problem. Quite annoying.

I just checked my idle temps for my GPU and they now sit at around 45c when it's usually in the low 30's. Fan curve hasn't changed.

Also to add: my PC still powers USB peripherals when switched off. I've tried the suspend setting but it's still happening."

I am attending architecture school in the fall and will be needing a new pc. As I used a DELL laptop in my undergrad and 1. did not like the price-to-performance ratio and 2. realized I did not need the mobility of a laptop, I decided to build a PC. This is my first time building a PC and would love any advice and input!

I will be using it for architecture school so that is mostly 3D modeling and rendering. As I have a scholarship and a stipend from my school, I wanna set my budget around the 2K mark. I currently have the following selected on pcpartpicker.

|CPU|AMD Ryzen 9 3900X|

|Motherboard|ASUS TUF X570|

buildapc,"Been console gaming since I was a kid. Started with N64 and i currently have XboxOneS, PS4 and Switch. the most PC gaming I've done is minecraft on my old family HP, then once I got my laptop I've played more MC, also ive played fortnite once but i mainly play LoL on my laptop. My best friend and I have always talked about building our own PC's primarily for gaming and maybe even streaming in the future. Been saving up (especially with that stimulus money) and was just hoping for some advice, whether simple/basic or advanced/complicated.

To narrow some stuff down; I know more about PC components than the average person, but nowhere near to the extent as most people in this sub. In high school i took lots of computer classes like digital media, game art and design. and in college i've taken IT security and Computer programming so I know the basics of coding and computer software workings but Im not so great with hardware knowledge. I know bare basics from watching streamers and PC building videos and my classes but when I see all the different components like gpu, ram, cpu, ssd or hdd, etc really overwhelms me in terms of what their actual functionalities are and also what brands should you go for.

Also to help narrow a little bit more some of the games I would want to play are Overwatch (huge fan. been playing on xbox since release and wanted to play it on PC so bad for years now), valorant, COD (mainly MW/Warzone), Apex Legends and i dont really mind tuning down graphics settings to like medium for some of the games. Also not just shooters but RPGs like maneater and the upcoming AC Valhalla. and fighters like DB Fighterz and Naruto UNS series. I own Xbox Game Pass ultimate so I would take advantage of the Xbox play anywhere and play lots of my games on the PC. and as i mentioned earlier I would like it to be able to handle potentially stream one day and video editing software. I do lots of stuff like PSD/Adobe but my laptop is mainly used for that (along with typical searching and tasks)

I know this is a ton of random info for what I could've probably summed up pretty shortly but I hope it shows just how out of my element I am! My friend has also mentioned shops/websites where you select your components and they will build and ship you the PC but I'm not sure how reliable that is or what to look for. Feel free to reply or pm! and thanks in advanced for taking the time to read my post!"

buildapc,"My first PC was built with a buddy in 2013. I've upgraded a few parts (GPU/HD) throughout the years but it's time to forge myself a new PC. 

Budget: $1k. As I am reusing my GPU and HD's my current build is $616.
Goal: Last another 5-7 years with only needing to upgrade the GPU halfway through.
Usage: Gaming and Chrome. My current rig can't meet demands of my ultrawide (3440x1440) while I game and have a chrome window open on my 2nd screen. This is the reason for my upgrade so that I can watch Disney+/Youtube while playing WoW/FFXIV. I'll occasionally play FPS games as well.

My previous build was Intel and while I know AMD is better bang for the buck I still prefer to stay on Intel.

I would like your recommendation on the build, anything I might missed, from what I can tell most components are available right now, but might have to make modifications based on availability

buildapc,"Hello guys! I have a work laptop and my gaming one. I recently bought a monitor, another mouse and a keyboard. The gaming laptop is connected to the monitor via DisplayPort, the work laptop via HDMI and I can switch inputs. When I'm working, I usually use my monitor as the main one, with the work laptop as a secondary display, and the gaming laptop on the side.

Is it possible to connect the same mouse and keyboard to both of these laptops? So I don't have to plug them out of the work laptop and back into my own. I heard about Synergy, which is a software solution that doesn't work for me, as I cannot install any software on the work laptop. Is there such thing as a USB splitter or something similar?"

1. What Part Should Be Prioritized First Between a Motherboard and Ram? Which Has The Biggest Chance To Go Up In Cost Usually
2. What Parts Should Generally Be Prioritized As First To Buy Due To Their Rising Or Lowering Costs?

buildapc,"Recently I've been noticing my 2600x temps hitting high 80s when playing Apex Legends however MSI afterburner only shows about 40-50% CPU usage. On the other hand it shows that my GPU (Vega 56) is under almost full load but temps usually remain under 70C. I am also using the NZXT H500 case with the two stock fans and the stock CPU cooler (wraith spire). Also nothing is overclocked. Apex however runs fine, I'm getting around 120fps on max settings 1080p.

How can I reduce temperatures? Is this a problem with using the stock cooler?"
buildapc,"I'm currently on an Intel i7-6700K & Asus ROG Maximus VIII system. I'm using it maybe 30% for gaming and the rest for coding, photo and video editing and many browser sessions. Things are still running pretty good, but I do get an occasional situation where I need to bulk convert a large number of videos, see some delays in file operations or am starting to question if I have bottlenecks. Another concern is the increasingly noticeable lack of fast, modern connectivity, as I have USB3.0 but no USB-C or faster standards like USB3.2 Gen2 at my current machine, but have lots of USB-C devices.

In summary, there's certainly no immediate mandatory upgrade necessary, but after almost 5 years I feel like a renewal of the main platform would be about time, and I spend a lot of time with it so I'd like to keep it a pleasant experience.

Things I'm wondering about:

* My last AMD CPU must have been about 20 years ago, so I'm new to their ecosystem. I think that X570 is more future-proof, but I don't know if I'd get what I want with another chipset and lower cost
* The price jump from 3700X to 3900X is significant. On one hand I'm not sure I'd really need the extra 4 Cores, but assuming this will be my new foundation for the next couple years, this might be the wrong end to save
* I'm aware that the XT CPUs are about to get released, but it appears they won't be much different so not sure if it's worth to wait (except maybe for pricing)
* Similar for Zen 3... My understanding is that those would still work on an X570 board, but I'm unclear what to expect in terms of performance jump or price drops
* Again low noise operation is really important. If there's any red flags please call them out

When picking components I'm trying to strike a balance between renewing the foundation but keeping parts in place which can be replaced later and are still relatively up to date.

Here's what I came up with:

A few notes about the build:

* When picking components I'm trying to strike a balance between renewing the foundation but keeping parts in place which can be replaced later or are still up to date
* The OS is installed currently in the 950 Pro NVMe drive and would remain there
* I didn't pick a PSU as I expect to reuse the existing one and not sure which model that is
* I would love to get rid of the 3.5"" disk and go SSD-only but I need the space and it's not cost effective. The additional 1TB 960 Evo NVMe drive is a first step towards that

Thanks!"
buildapc,"Hello!

So I have an ASUS Vivobook X420u, it originally came with 118gb disk. I want to upgrade it to a 250gb. I havent opened it up but from my research I think the 118gb SSD is a M.2. 

My question is, I see people talking about cloning by current disk to the new disk but how is this possible if my laptop only has one slot for an SSD?  I see videos using software to clone HDD to SSD but that makes sense since they can insert both into the laptop. I do have a second laptop so could I use this second laptop to help?

Thanks.

 tl;dr how to replace my current SSD with a larger SSD?"

I recently bought the 2070s as an upgrade to my r9 290. And with this I get large amounts of flickering, jagged edges, shimmering, pop-ins, low LOD, and weird texture pixelations when gaming. It does not matter what game I play, they all have the same issue. I play at 2560x1080p at 75Hz, which should be no issue with this card. And with this I get zero stuttering, and a consistent 75fps on maxed settings on any game. But no matter how much AA I use, and no matter the settings I get these same issues. With the r9 290 I have the same issues. 

&#x200B;

This video kinda illustrates what I mean about the textures, although it is usually a lot more extreme than this.

I've monitored my temperatures in games and theres nothing out of the ordinary as my GPU never goes above 70C. My CPU does sometimes climb to 80C as I am still using the stock cooler.

As far as trouble shooting goes I have tried underclocking and undervolting my card and CPU, updated all my bios including my MOBO, I've updated windows and checked for malware, I've also put my GPU into another system with a different PSU and CPU, I've tried using a different monitor, I've tried different response times and frame rates, I've tried reinstalling my GPU, I've tried reinstalling windows, wiping all drivers,. Nothing has worked and I am not sure what the issue is. Is this a Motherboard issue? GPU issue? PSU? I can't find a fix and I am losing my mind Any ideas?"

buildapc,"I have been looking forward to this day for the past 3 weeks only to have Best Buy not fulfill my curbside pick up order.  They waited until the end of the day to say the order is delayed; if they can not find one then they will have to cancel my order and refund me.  The real predicament is that I used a credit card to get a free welcome bonus of $200.  If Best Buy refunds my order I would breach the TOS of the welcome bonus and the CC company will rescind the $200.  

So now here I am shopping around once again for a Motherboard and Graphics card.  I was really excited to build my pc tonight and now it is looking like I will be stuck waiting another week.  So next time you are ordering something from Best Buy i thoroughly suggest you just have it delivered to your house.  

I am going to check out my local computer parts store tomorrow to see if I can just get what I need there and cancel the order from Best Buy.  It's just kind of frustrating because I feel like they have the technology to know when they have something in transit to one of their stores, and yet they waited until the last second to say delayed.

buildapc,"What processor, graphics card, & motherboard would give me the performance I need for 1440p gaming @120fps+ without the need for high/ultra quality graphics with the potential for upgrading the graphics card in the future for 1440p gaming @120fps+ with high/ultra quality settings?

I want to sacrifice the quality of graphics for performance. This is to save some money until I have the cash to get a powerful GPU such as the RTX 2080 Ti or next generation graphic cards. I like to play FPS games, such as Warzone.

The goal is to play the game at the same speed and fluidity as a competitive gamer, while making it as affordable as possible till I have the necessary money to enjoy the luxury of maxed-out graphics. Any advice or thoughts about this type of build and plan would be much appreciated. I’m new to pc building and I’m trying to learn as much as possible so I could create any computer system for any specific purpose."

buildapc,"I'm planning to build a budget-mid tier PC within the next weeks which should run CS:GO at a competitive level and newer games in mid-high resolution fluently. I could get an i5 6600K with mobo and 16 GB RAM very cheap (\~150€) but I do know that this model is from 2015 and there is surely no upgrade path. Currently I'm playing on a laptop, which cannot even deliver >60 fps in CS:GO - so anything is a big upgrade to me.  
By this, I could spend more on the GPU - settling somewhere between an RX580 to an 1660 SUPER + a nice, quiet case which would serve me for many years.

So I was wondering if I should take the old CPU for the beginning, and could still upgrade in few years (therefore exchanging mobo, CPU and RAM) or going for a more recent build with the B450 + 2600 or 3600 (or 3300x), which also does not provide a real upgrade path (unless I wait for the B550).

Thanks for any advice!"

Bought this PC from Best buy a couple years ago with the intention to upgrade over time, I got an SSD to start but I couldn't get into bios, it would go straight from power on to windows login screen and all the keyboard presses didn't get me to bios screen so I looked up and saw advice that resetting the battery can remedy that. Since doing so, the PC will now show no display at all. It powers on, the original hard  drive is functioning, all fans spinning properly, LEDs working etc but there is no display. Keyboard/mouse are powered but unresponsive (caps/num lock buttons not responding etc)

 I tried a ton of suggestions (reseating ram, one ram, no ram,  in different slots, removing gpu and using integrated) other cmos reset suggestions as well and still nothing. I've bought new ram and even with those in any combination its the same issue. I'm really struggling and frustrated after spending 2 whole days trying everything I can think of or find online. Any help would be greatly appreciated & sorry for wall of text ty to those that read through it"
buildapc,"Hello All,

So, I went to repaste my CPU (6700k, M8H) and when I did I bent pins. Wasn't recognizing memory (post code 55) so I fixed the pins and after resetting CMOS I was able to get into BIOS, all my memory was recognized. However, I was unable to boot into windows. I am getting stuck at the ROG screen with the little spinning wheel but cant get past that, it freezes. I am getting a wide variety of post codes including good ones like NVRAM initializing, q code 02, etc.

Even trying to boot from a USB install of windows I can't get into windows. I am simply at a loss of what to do here. I am as of this moment flashing my Bios to see if I screwed that up but right now I have a black screen with nothing on it after flashing from a USB drive. I've tried pulling GPUs, trying to repair windows mulitple times, no dice.

Is my mobo dead? I am going to let it flash BIOS overnight and check again in the AM. Any other suggestions? If this doesn't get me into Windows I am going to start pulling RAM and trying single sticks. Any advice is appreciated."

buildapc,"A few days before one of my ram stopped working, so brought 2 extra ram to replace/upgrade my build for rendering works. Now I have tested all my rams would work in single channel configuration, but if I put in a dual channel configuration my computer won't boot, if I put in a mis match order, it would detect my ram but get capped to 16gb. So I reset my cmos and updated my bios to 1203 but didn't work. So I decided to put the previous rams I had the way it was working before but now as soon as I boot into windows I would get a stopcode bsods and after reboot the boot code would get stuck to 90 or bootloop indefinitely. I heard in some forums Threadrippers has some memory detection problems and refitting the cpu would may solve the issue but I am not that skilled enough to do that and I don't know if I need any thermal paste in doing so. If this really is the same case with my build please let me know. In this lockdown I can't call any technician neither I can work either and I am really in a state of panic.

buildapc,"Hi folks, 

I'm making my first build and pretty much got all components ordered and figured out. I ended up getting a 500GB NVME m.2 as my main boot storage but want to supplement my build with a more cost-effective drive. I've narrowed it down to two options: a 2TB SSHD at 5600 rpm (99$) vs a 2TB HDD at 7200 rpm ($55). 

Is the SSHD really worth the price difference? Would it actually be a faster read/write even at 5600 rpm? Marketing makes the SSHD seem way more superior and worth the extra $$, but forum reviews are mixed. I'd mostly use the secondary drive to store music and games. Thoughts? 

Thanks in advance."

linux4noobs,"Hi, part of my tasks is to determine the standard specs for provisioning servers, how do you estimate the requirements when setting up a web/database server?

Here's my current:

OS: CentOS8 (staple)

Memory: 16GB - considering future apps to be run on the same web server

Partitions:

1. /root - for apps and services needed, 2x size on test server or at least 50GB
2. /var/log - for logs, 2x size on test server or at least 100GB
3. /mdb - database server only, I'll be moving my MariaDB datadir here
4. /dmp - for log archive, keeps 3 months worth of backlog, database backups also stored here

What inbound and outbound connections should I enable on my public and private IP? For firewall I usually open the default ports (80, 443, 3306) but sometimes we use a different port so we won't use the default ones. 

Also I think that having 16GB is too much? Thanks!"
linux4noobs,"Hello! Welcome to me, I just joined the Linux community, I am converting from Windows. Since I'm very new to this, expect me to be very dumb on this topic. Enough of that, I don't want to buy any more of your time reading this.

Before I start, my purpose of installing Linux is mostly programming, daily driver, and basically run things faster. So, not so much into gaming, but I don't want to entirely get rid of gaming.

I am considering to install MX Linux as my first distro. I heard people praising it so much (well mostly are posts from last year so I don't know about now) and left me no reason on why I shouldn't install it, but the same goes for Ubuntu too.

So for what reason that I should choose one over another? What are the pros and cons? I don't mind the UI much, but more to functionality, stability, support, and compatibility. Since I couldn't gather much info between the differences of these two. I am somewhat confuse on which one should I install.

Another thing that I'm confused of is; What is xfce, mate, and cinnamon? Does it matter much? How does it affect my choice when I've never used Linux at all?

Also, as I mentioned, gaming is not my main purpose for installing Linux, but if I were to install Linux for gaming, will it also affect on which distro I should install?

I'm sorry for asking too many questions. I'm totally new to this hoping I don't sound too dumb.

Edit: I figured I should include my system specifications.

A Low-end Laptop (acer Aspire 3 ~ A314-31-C0SG)
- Intel Celeron Processor N3350
- Intel HD Graphics
- 4GB DDR3 L 
- 500GB HDD

If MX Linux nor Ubuntu is not a good choice as my first distro, it would be very much appreciated if you suggest some."

linux4noobs,"I have for years found the hobby of helping people on this subreddit enjoyable and wanted to offer you all an update to aid you in these trying times with your struggles adjusting to and learning to love penguins!

As some of you know [i've been a stalwart supporter of Gentoo Linux](https://i.imgur.com/xunZS.png) since 2003 due to the educational merits and flexibility afforded by ""baking your own binaries"" and configuring  your own install to suit your own hardware or purpose.  
  
This is great but the build time required to compile all that software does dissuade some people from making an attempt.

I've precompiled Gentoo Linux ""stage4"" tar.gz base system installs and [released them on this sub in December 2019 and several previous occasions](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/e84gh6/precompiled_gentoo_linux_171_extra_special/) however i felt the changes since December warranted creating a new semi annual post update.
  
In December i began providing three gpu specific configurations for Intel amd and nvidia graphics cards and given positive feedback have continued this in a similar fashion to Systemd76 Pop!_ OS 

featuring kde plasma with full support for 32 bit applications then add support for docker, qemu, lutris, steam, wine staging 5.9 and much more!
  
These builds contain the base gentoo install stage used  for the initial builds in the root filesystem within the tarballs for each build dated December 12 2019

These builds are an update of the finest gentoo chroot builds assembled to date i've released to the general public :)  

* So what the feck is a stage4?  
  
Gentoo Linux releases system install base systems as compressed archives that include the bare minimum software necessary for Linux to reproduce itself and any other software program. Historically Gentoo used to allow users to progress to this point by building up to several ""stages"" from stage 1 to stage 3 then later settled on only providing stage3.  

Stage4 is terminology Gentoo Linux users frequently use to refer to only the filesystem contents that comprises any completed and archived installation.  

Stage4 Gentoo system backup largely replaces the [install stage choices offered the gentoo install handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Stage#Downloading_the_stage_tarball)  
  
* Why the feck would I want this?  
  
As many people have discovered that attempt using Linux software configuration can be inflexible or incompatible after it's been prepackaged for distros such as Ubuntu or Mint or you pick one and no avenue to recompile that software is provided to adapt that software for only your own hardware configuration to ""fine tune"" and eliminate consistency conflicts or eliminate an overabundance of software features having been supported.  
  
*** These builds will require some customization and additional config to become bootable if you choose to proceed with further system install configuration ***

linux4noobs,"Hello all!

I  am currently trying to get my current addiction (AoE2: DE) over onto my  Ubuntu environment.  I have a system with an Nvidia 1060, and have  confirmed that Vulkan is installed with `vulkaninfo`(yielding version 1.2.131) and that my drivers are installed with `nvidia-smi`(yielding driver version 440.64).  However, when I go to click on the  ""play"" button in Steam, it acts like it's going to load (grey ""preparing  game"" box, blue ""cancel"" button) and then stops.

Additional helpful info:

My games are stored on an NTFS partition on a completely (physically) separate drive, with read and write permissions.

I  am attempting to run the game through Steam with the help of Proton  5.0-7.  I have Steam Play enabled for all titles, and I am on Steam's  beta channel.  I've also tried running the game with GloriousEggroll's Proton version.

I have also deleted  two game files, one being the movies in the \_common resources, and the  other as the en resources.  Additionally, I have already applied the  multiplayer patch.  Both of these steps that I followed were documented  in [this tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/dwuplr/how_to_run_age_of_empires_2_definitive_edition_on/).

I've restarted my system multiple times through this process.

Any help is much appreciated.  Thank you all!

&#x200B;

EDIT:  I'm now noticing that it's any non-native game on Steam.  I have tried using Steam's built-in Proton, GE's Proton, and rolling back to Proton 4.11-13; no dice.

EDIT 2:  Fiddling with the launch options as per [this post](https://askubuntu.com/questions/325403/steam-fails-to-launch-game) fails to resolve the issue.

EDIT 3:  Solution found!  Since my games were on another NTFS partition, [this post](https://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/8/1734336452589279477/) (and [this linked post](https://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/8/1734336452580075743/), with the actual solution) allowed me to access all of my games.  Cheers, my linux friends!"

linux4noobs,"When I load up programs like RetroArch or OpenRA, the power management stays active, where as normally if I'm on a video or transferring files, a red icon turns up near the power management telling me it's held by a running process, but not these.

Online searches show this is a fairly common issue too. Anyone know of some good solutions? My Distro is Manjaro 5.6.12.1, with the Cinnamon Desktop Enviroment. I was recommended a tool like Joystickwake.

https://github.com/foresto/joystickwake

But I don't know if anyone can vouch for that one, particularly on Manjaro since the AUR version looks like it's out of date, so I don't know if it works or if it'll break some things, There's a similar tool for Fullscreen winodws but I don't always play games Fullscreen.

linux4noobs,"Hello.

  
Thanks in advance for reading this post. I have a new  computer with an Athlon 3000G and an ASUS Prime A320M-K. I used Manjaro  in my ThinkPad and I wanted to use it too with this computer. Everything  works out of the box with the exception of any kind of game. I tried to  run Skullgirls, Xonotic, and even Viridi, but all them have the same  visual glitches. Here is an album with pictures of the glitch.

  
[https://imgur.com/a/I51EVxw](https://imgur.com/a/I51EVxw)

  
After  that, I installed Windows 10 to discard any kind of damage to the CPU  or the iGPU (because I do not have a dedicated graphic card). What I  find interesting is that everything works perfect in Windows. I can play  Skullgirls, Viridi, and even Borderlands 2 withouth any glitches or  problems at all. However, I prefer to use a Linux distribution. So, I  tried to install Ubuntu, POP OS, and Endeavour, but the graphic glitch  also happened in those distros.  
Thus, my question is,  is there a solution to those glitches?

  
Thanks again."
linux4noobs,"I've kept a windows install alongside my linux partition for a while for the rare situations when I need it (most recent example, needed to hook up my moms wireless printer).

I booted in to windows and my fans started spinning up like crazy.  At first I assumed it was because it needed to update because its been so long, and I think partially it was because of this.  Fast-forward 30 mins later after multiple reboots - windows says its completely up to date.  Task manager says CPU and memory usage is low despite my fans going 100%. (ventilation was fine btw)

This goes on for like 20+ minutes.  Clearly something is running, but task manager wont even tell me.  This is pretty much a fresh install btw.  Its got just the essentials installed, and I uninstall anything after im done with it - its just for when its needed (not even gaming).

I reboot into Manjaro and everything is fine again.  For a minute I was thinking maybe the thermal paste wore off or something got knocked loose. Clearly this isnt the case and im pretty sure windows was stealing as much data as it could in the time that I was away from my windows install.

Im just gonna dedicate an old thinkpad for my windows tasks and keep this garbage off my main laptop.  

It's not surprising, since I KNOW this is what windows just does now, but somehow it still seems even worse when you experience it first hand."

I've installed Audio Recorder but I don't see a way to enter a url or have it record web browser audio.  It can accept Rhythmbox and Banshee as inputs but how can I get either of those apps to start the radio station upon starting the app? Also, I can't figure out how to see a list of scheduled recordings (if that's even possible in Audio Recorder).

So then I thought maybe I could use cron or systemd to open a url at a specific time and day and record for a set length of time and then close the apps BUT I've spent almost every evening for the past two weeks searching and reading and trying and I just can't figure it out.

Long story short, she chose Linux Mint. After a few months, it was completely smooth sailing. Until recently, she has encountered an issue where every time she boots up the machine, it would boot into the command prompt.

I eventually figured out how to boot into the desktop by typing ""startx"" into the initial command prompt, and they she would be presented with her normal login screen asking for a password.

So I've just uploaded a quick video on how to use Green With Envy (GWE) to overclock and control fans on nVidia GPUs.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAKe9ladLvc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAKe9ladLvc)

The video covers installation, and enabling nVidia coolbits so you can actually use the overclocking and fan control functionality.

Clearly aimed at newbies, but might be useful for anyone wanting to get some extra juice out of their system.

Or for people who prefer a written guide.

**INSTALLATION**

Install from the Flathub page.

[https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.leinardi.gwe](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.leinardi.gwe)

**ENABLING OVERCLOCKING AND FAN CONTROL FUNCTIONALITY**

Add the following to your xorg.conf file between the Section “Device” and EndSection:

Option “Coolbits” “12”

For example:

Section ""Device""

Identifier ""Device0""

Driver ""nvidia""

VendorName ""NVIDIA Corporation""

BoardName ""GeForce GTX 1080""

Option ""Coolbits"" ""12"" EndSection

For most distributions, the xorg.conf file is located at /etc/X11.

Save the changes and reboot to apply.

**USING GWE**

Create a new profile for Fan Control or Overclock, click on the pencil icon, set your parameters and then click the Apply button.

**As always if you found this helpful, please consider subscribing to my channel to support me.**

I use this laptop for university classes and i want to install gnu/linux on it. However, i don't feel comfortable deleting windows , so i figured that i should dual boot and install the other os in the hard drive.

My question is, since there is data on the hdd that are related to windows (installed on the ssd) , are there any complications lurking if i decide to dual boot and install the other os on the hard drive? How should i go about installing the other os?

the gnu/linux distribution will probably be ubuntu or manjaro. I'm mentioning this just in case it plays a significant part in the problem.

linux4noobs,"After switching to POP OS and figuring out the software installation method for many programs is comprised mainly of adding ppa after ppa, I'm confused why ubuntu based distros like linux mint, POP OS, elementary, zorin, and Ubuntu itself are the go to recommendation for distros for beginners.

Beginner posts and guides often recommend veering away from the terminal to not intimidate beginners and let them get used to the OS but then they'll recommend ubuntu based distros for which using the terminal and adding ppas can be the only option for alot of essential programs, if its even available through ppa or instead having to install software through snaps, for which the community normally recommends against.

Compared to using something like Manjaro which  has the access to the AUR. I know its based on Arch but from what I understand Manjaro is similar in complication to ubuntu. But a one stop centralized area to download whatever software the user needs, including software that may only  be available on Ubuntu as a snap to me seems to make Manjaro the far more user friendly choice for almost any beginner.

I'll also be recontacting older mods but i never had answers in previous attempts so if they are still inactive, i'll remove them i guess.

The *in fine* goal is to have a couple of mods that can moderate posts and comments at any time and therefore having more time to make the sub reddit evolve, like new flairs and other options.

i had the same two models of 4GB of RAM on my Motherboard, but they are 6 years old and one is disconnecting very frequently, so i brought a new one, a single 16GB RAM, problem is,  
due to not knowing much about RAM (even thought i tried to do a thorough research)  
the Motherboard refuses the RAM, it does not turn on and the ""Beeps"" tells me it's a RAM issue,  
if i put it with a single 4GB RAM, the PC does turn on, but it shows only the 4GB RAM installed (though programs do detect there is a 16GB RAM installed too, it just does not use it)

So after asking around, i realized that i need to buy ANOTHER one, but i'm very confused on the Exact reason that 16GB RAM didn't work for me...  
I was hoping someone could help me!  
Specifications:  
***MOTHERBOARD:*** **GA-H110M-HD3 DDR3**  
***OLD RAM:*** **KVR13N9S8/4 DDR3** (2X8GB)  
***NEW RAM:*** **M393B2G70CB0-YH9 DDR3** (1X16GB)

I also have another question after looking for an definitive answer, from what i gather, these models should work, can any of you verify this?  
Models:  
**-M393B2G70QH0-YK0 SAMSUNG**  
**-CORSAIR CMV16GX3M2A1600C11**  
**-HP 672612-081**  
**-KINGSTON KVR16N11**  
I'm sorry for anything, and thank you for reading!"
pcgamingtechsupport,"My games keep crashing and it’s really frustrating. It’s mostly Rainbow Six Siege and Modern Warfare. I’ve tried verifying game files. I’ve tried to lower my settings. I also keep an eye on my pc stats with msi afterburner and nothing goes above 70 or 80 Celsius when OC. However, my GPU does run in the 90% range. I’ve tried going into mscconfig and disabling my non windows programs which seemed to work but it dropped my monitor from 1440p to 1050p. Is there anyway to prevent my games from crashing mid game without having my screen look like a potato?

pcgamingtechsupport, I’m thinking about buying a new 27-inch monitor and right now I have a 24 inch. I do a lot of aim trainer on my 24 so if I make the switch to a 27-inch monitor will my aim get worse? And if it does get worse how long will it take to get used to the new monitor.

I’ve absolutely tried everything I could, and followed any guide I could find to fix this error. My Microsoft Visual C++s, DirectX runtimes and .NET frameworks have been updated multiple times, including using softwares from a couple blogs that check and update if there’s an issue. I’ve also tried replace and fix all .dll files in appropriate 32 and 64 bit folders with no success.

I’ve tried for about a week now and was sure that I wouldn’t need to start a new thread over this very old issue but here I am.

My hard disks are working fine, and I’m having this issue specifically with Origin, PUBG, PUBG Lite and GTA V. All other games including COD MW, Forza, Cities Skylines, Minecraft and everything else that I have is working.

If there any suggestions or fixes that you think I haven’t tried out, please let me know. I would hope they don’t have anything to do with reinstalling Windows because that would be painful.

pcgamingtechsupport,"Hello everyone, just to get this out there, I'm not that great when it  comes to computers. I have researched this topic a lot and am quite literally stumped. I have a Lenovo Legion Y720 with 16gb ram and the GeForce GTX 1060 and an intel i7-7700 processor. All drivers are updated. Internet speed is ~200 download and 30 upload.
  
Now to the issue: I have started to stream games and am running into the issue that the game is running flawlessly and the SECOND I hit ""Start Stream"" in OBS Studio, my kb/s goes from 5-6k down to literally 0-100. The moment I quit the game, it jumps back up to the 5-6k. Sometimes when I restart my laptop and try again, the issue doesn't happen. I have called my ISP and there is no throttling or packet loss they are seeing. I've tried both on wifi and hardwired with the same outcome. I've disabled my Private Network firewall with the same outcome. I'm at a loss. I'm getting very frustrated and figured I'd turn to people much smarter than I when it comes to these types of things.  
  
Any help would be greatly appreciated and I can share more details if you need them.  
  
Thanks again."
pcgamingtechsupport,"Over the weekend Albion Online started acting very strangely. All my characters move super slowly, and movement oriented skills like a dash just make my character do a super slow motion jump effect rather than instantly leaping. Ping is below 50ms. I thought it was just Albion as it's been known to have server issues so I moved on.

----

Then it started in League of Legends- ping is also constantly below 50ms. Most functions in the game are fine (no rubberbanding/lag), except the cooldown timers are consistently wrong and my character's movements are ever so mildly off- IE rather than turning direction sharply it will be a slightly slower ""floaty"" change of direction. On the cooldowns: my screen will say my ultimate is available, but if press it right as it comes off cooldown and it doesn't fire. One might think lag is just delaying the skill going off, but if I just wait a couple seconds after the cooldown timer says the skill is available and then press it- it goes off immediately and I am capable of hitting the enemy with the skill as expected. There is some kind of strange de-sync between my PC and the server. I would think perhaps packet loss, but I've been through that before and the game is way too responsive in every other way. Also: The pre-game countdown timer before the game starts is out of sync. When there is ~30 seconds remaining, then suddenly correct itself to ~10 seconds remaining. Then the game will start with ~5 seconds remaining.

----

One final bit of info that might point to a problem: recently my wifi (yes, I know) would disconnect if my adapter was plugged into any of the rear ports. Plug it into the front and it doesn't happen. Tried it with another wifi adapter with the same results. I think the issue may be hardware as I didn't install any software updates/drivers/etc. prior to all this starting. Perhaps the mobo is going bad? Is there anything specific I could try to diagnose if it's the mobo or not?

**CPU:** Intel Core i5 3570k CPU@ 3.4GHz, no overclock

**Motherboard:** Asus P8Z77-V LK

**RAM:** Ripjaws DDR3-1066MHz CL7-7-7 1.50V4GB (2x4GB)

**PSU:** EVGA NEX 650G (P/N 120-PG-0650)

**Operating System & Version:** Win 10 64-bit OS, x64-based processor

**GPU Drivers:** 446.14-desktop-win10-64bit-international-, clean install

**Description of Problem:** I was playing league of legends when i noticed the screen was starting to tear, game froze, and then the screen turned black. I reset the computer only for the windows 10 boot to freeze (the wheel stopped spinning for \~5 minutes) so I reset again and booted in safemode.

Computer has since had the ""code 32"" Windows detected an issue with GPU and disabled it. Or ""code 22"" when i disabled GPU trying to flash the BIOS.

**Troubleshooting:**

1. Tried a clean install in safe mode of previous 660Ti drivers ""445.87-desktop-win10-64bit-international-dch-whql"" --> no change, automatically goes to black screen
2. Tried clean install of original 660Ti driver which was being used at the time ""446.14-desktop-win10-64bit-international-dch-whql"" --> no change, automatically goes to black screen
3. Tried to flash the BIOS by installing nvFlash and found the correct BIOS via GPU-Z and backed up my previous BIOS. But I haven't been able to get the cmd prompt to run the ""--protectoff"" since cmd isn't running NVflash correctly (checked the pathway is running and NVflash is functioning)

Other note: External Fans are running abnormally fast which is an issue i'm not familiar with.

pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi, sorry if this post breaks any rules here since I'm a first time poster to this subreddit but I just ran into a problem since this morning.

Earlier today a scammer messaged me on steam asking to buy an item from my inventory. After ignoring him he then said that he was going to get my account banned. Well I check back after an hour and it looks like my account has indeed been banned - there were hundreds of comments on my profile from bots saying that they reported me, I have lost access to all of my game licenses, and my account name is just a number.

I made a ticket to steam support immediately after and a user by the name of Steam | Nathan messaged me saying that my account has been blocked because of mass reports and that all of my games and inventory will be removed.

Is this actually legit? Is there anything that I can do to prevent this/recover my account? I have 2 factor authentication on my phone. What should my next steps be?

pcgamingtechsupport,"I just managed to solve a big issue I had with DS4 controller playing gta 5, so I decided to share it, it should work on all other games.  


My issue was: the right trigger is damaged from use, allowing max 70% of input from it.

At first I was using DS4windows program, but somewhere down the line updates from either the game or the ds4 caused ds4 to no longer have priority in the game, so while it worked in other games, not in gta5.

Hardware fix wasnt something I was comfortable doing until the controller isnt usable at all cause there is likelihood I would brick it.

Solution: Using windows 10 'set up usb controllers' utility which can be found by just typing its name into the windows search bar. The Issue now is that the utility is only made for xbox controllers or some other reason that mandates ANY button press of the controller as a confirmation of a finished calibration task. This results in an infuriating situation in DS4 controller which has the analog triggers with buttons in them, so whenever you want to calibrate them, you end up with a wrong result because half-way down the analog press, the button activates which prematurely finishes the calibration process.

&#x200B;

Solution: Hold down the button that was used as a confirmation of the end of the previous task until you finish the next task, at which point you release it, and immediately hold it down for confirmation of your current task, and release it again only after you finish the next task. This hold down of the button causes the buttons in analog triggers to not register as a button press, allowing you to fully press down the triggers and calibrating it properly.

&#x200B;

Example: In the calibration wizard one of the tasks named 'axis calibration' and the first one Z-axis its the first of the tasks that focuses on analog inputs and because it doesn't have a built-in button half-way down its axis, its calibrated easily. But the next axis calibration following it \[X rotation\] does. Its the left trigger L2. So after you finish the Z axis calibration, you hold down a confirmation button and dont let go until you have finished the L2 calibration as well. To confirm the end of the L2 calibration now you must release the confirmation button and hold it down again until you finish the next task for calibrating the R2 analog trigger. You chain together the confirmations of the calibrations and the buttons inside the L2 and R2 wont trigger the unwanted confirmation. Now both triggers can be calibrated properly.

GTA 5 was running smoothly on above 100 fps on 1660 rarerly dipping below.

On 2060 same graphics settings its under 100 and sometimes goes as low as 70.

Legue of legends i was getting steady framerate above 120 later in the game

Now later in game it gets under 100 fps always on the 2060.

I could not ctrl alt del, or anything else. I had to press the power button in order to shut down. This also happened two days ago, but the difference is, two days ago I was able to boot. Yesterday, I was met with no monitor signal. I cleared CMOS, expecting that to fix everything. I was met with the same result. No signal, black screen. I figured maybe it was a display issue. I tried a different cable, and I tried a different PC with the same cable. Then, I cleared CMOS again. I was met with the ""CMOS cleared, press F1 etc"" screen, but my PC was not recognizing keyboard input. I turned off the power and turned my PC on. No signal. Cleared CMOS. No signal. Cleared CMOS again. This time, I was able to get into the BIOS. Everything was fine. I clicked ""Save changes and reboot"". Same result. No signal. Removed CPU (Ryzen 5 3600), all pins were fine. Reinstalled CPU and pain-in-the-ass cooler. No signal. Monitor still recognized Mac mini and laptop with same cable. I can't test for a dead GPU since my CPU has no iGPU.

pcgamingtechsupport,"So i bought this laptop at the beginning of the year. I was pretty satisfied in the beginning as i was able to play lol at 120 fps and most non-online games were outputting 60 fps or better on very high/ultra. That began to slowly change as the performance got worse and worse. I began by underclocking the cpu and that helped a while. then I opened it to apply new thermal paste, Flash forward to now. The laptop is always on an external cooler. is undervolted, repasted and temps are good. But i cant play games. Even league of legends when i start a game it gets me 120 fps, then its slowly gets worse. By the end of the 40 min game im getting 90 fps. If i restart the laptop the frames come back to 120 but then i get lag spikes with 90 fps again, temps are under 70C for both cpu and gpu during gaming.I obviously cant go with a warranty repair because i voided the warranty when i opened it to repaste The thing is that lowering the settings in games does absolutely nothing... so idk. what do you guys think?

pcgamingtechsupport,"A few days ago I was playing Escape From Tarkov and my computer shut off mid game. When I restarted all the led and fans turned on for about 2 seconds then it shut off, it did that about 5 times then it finally booted up like it normally would. I go into the BIOS and see the its been reset so I load my overclock profile and play for a few more hours, but now with some new coil whine coming from my radiator fans. After I shut off my computer I thought I'd boot it back up to see of it would start up normally and it did the same thing, everything turned on for a couple seconds then it shut off a few times and the BIOS was reset. 

The next day I left everything at stock speeds, played some MW and Escape From Tarkov for a few hours and restarted with no issues so I thought I'd try the overclock again. I loaded up my overclock profile, but I didn't play anything, restarted it and it started right up with no issues. Then I played MW with the overclock for a few hours, restarted my pc and it booted back up normally. So I thought that was the end of it and the issue resolved it self, but I go to start my pc yesterday and the same thing started happening again.

I have since reseated my ram and tried a different PSU with no luck. Lowering the voltage on my CPU didn't seem to help either. I did manage to get the coil whine to go away but switching headers though so that's nice. Not sure were to go from here though so any suggestions are appreciated.              

I'd also like to note that my pc has not shut off mid game, with or with out the overclock, since the first time it happened and my temps have been normal across the board through all of this.

pcgamingtechsupport,"Not sure how to flair this, hopefully it fits in. I play destiny 2 super often but I play on your average PS4 controller. I use it with a cable, and I plug my headset into the controller for reasons I don’t exactly need to explain. Every few minutes or whenever I touch the cord it disconnects not only my controller and headset, but my mouse and keyboard too. Which is super frustrating. I’ve already swapped out the cable and I have the same problem. I’ve restarted my computer, I’ve cleaned my controller and nothing worked. Today I’m considering dismantling my controller and installing different parts from another controller. I have to do this because I can’t use the other controller due to intense stick drift. Is there anything else you think I should try first?"

pcgamingtechsupport,"There are 3 games that I've played in the last few months that I've experienced this with and it bothers the hell out of me while watching. AC: Odyssey, RDR2, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. In AC: Odyssey there are the cut-scenes that are just pre rendered videos that run just fine as you might imagine. But whenever there is an in-engine cut-scene or a dialogue moment where there are closeups of characters talking the animations look really jittery. The frame rate does not drop or anything, but the animations become painful to watch. It's like watching an old school jittery cartoon with the way the characters move. Can anyone tell me if there's a setting I need to change or explain why it's doing this?

pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi guys so I have a HP Omen which has been great for games the past year but all of a sudden all my games have insanely high ping when the charger is plugged in. It never used to be like this and I never had any issues, I recently started playing Valorant and it first occured on that game but now it happens on all games I play

Anyone have a fix?"

Hi,

Anyone with Samsung C49RG90 that plas day to day CS:GO?

I want this monitor but I also play a lot of CS GO and and I'm not sure if it's good idea to choose it for CS because of 32:9 proportion...

I want the perspective in other games like Anno, PoE, LoL, Cyberpunk in future etc. but I still want to have fun in CS.

I also consider LG 38GL950G which is 21:9.

Best regards"
pcgamingtechsupport,"Recently I built myself a new pc. However I only get connection to the monitors when my rtx 2080s gpu isnt connected. It isn't my graphics card that is the problem as my old 2060 gpu does the same thing in this new build. Additionally, i have tested my 2080 gpu in my old pc and that worked fine. 

&#x200B;

Things I have tried: 

I have updated the bios settings ( i think, I choose the second most recent update as the other one was via flash player.) 

I have switched it all off and on and tried plugging loads of different variations of display ports and HDMI cables.

turning off intel graphics 630 and rebooting with gpu 

&#x200B;

Possible causes:

i guess maybe the motherboard gpu slot is dodgy?

not enough power?

pcgamingtechsupport,"So I reinstalled windows 10 pro a month ago, because it kept doing a disk check that took 3 days and stopped working.

I did the usual, installed my GPU Driver, Network and Sound Drivers, installed Steam and started playing my games as per usual.

All was fine for about 2 days until my friends and I played GTAVO, I was doing a Heist mission when I realized my PC freezing and the sound stuttering (as if I was about to BSOD) but it recovered, but still happened. I played RDR2 last night and it happened again, I restarted, disabled all background programs and tried again, and it happened.

My computer doesn’t turn off or crashes, it always recovers, but the recovery is followed up by some more of those “stutters” I talked to my dad and he said it might be my DDR3 16GB RAM, but I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried everything. I haven’t seen anyone have this issue, so my help is very limited.

Alienware Aurora R4 (with default Motherboard and Cooling unit)

16GB DDR3 RAM

1Tb HDD (OS and almost empty so it only has the OS on)

5Tb HDD (storage medium for games and other files and documents)

&#x200B;

So the stuttering occurs randomly but I experienced it twice yesterday when I started playing RDR2, but it has occurred even when I had 3-4 tabs open in Google Chrome, watching YouTube in the other one. I've downloaded the Windows 10 Pro Image off of Microsoft's site, which makes you download the Image through a program you install and then installs it on a USB or Disk. I'd really really appreciate some assistance, and I'm always so uncertain of which flair to use for these types of posts so I'm just gonna label it as a Troubleshooting, if anyone thinks I should flair it as something else, please let me know."

pcgamingtechsupport,"So on Saturday, because of dumb reasons, I decided to clear my boot drive and reinstall Windows from a bootable USB. I took the oppurtunity to switch to Windows 10 Pro. Ever since, I have had a few weird issues that I just cannot solve.

The major ones involve Steam and Activision/Blizzard [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) game launchers. No matter what I do, my Steam desktop shortcut launcher will not connect when I sign in. I just get a message telling me it can't connect to the servers. The [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) installer won't even install the app launcher for me to attempt to sign in. However, both the Epic game launcher and Origin work just fine.

I know it is not my login, since I can log in to both using my browser.

Speaking of my browser, I keep getting error messages that DNS resolving didn't work and that there is no domain listed. I switched to Cloudflare [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) instead of my ISP's DNS resolver; no change. I tried completely disabling all of the Windows Defender firewalls since a few pop ups have said that it was blocking certain apps. No joy. I had a similar situation with Activision/Blizzard last year getting the game launcher working, so I installed the chipset driver from January that solved that problem rather than the later one from April. Nope.

There is a weird sound issue, as well. My headphones no longer seem to be working.

I am at a complete loss. I don't know what to do next. None of my hardware has changed, the only major difference is the Windows 10 Pro install and I don't know how that could be causing these myriad issues.

EDIT: Or How I solved all my problems and became a PC Master Race God!

There were a ton of good suggestions in the comments and I want to thank everyone who tried. I readily admit, I was prepared to commit hara kiri, or take a nap, last evening because all of these issue got to me.

I did solve some issues by going to Recover>Reset This PC as someone recommended. Of course, most of my apps, programs and games got wiped. So I had to start the long process of redownloading my Game Pass games on WiFi (long story).

But, my audio issue was solved and now my headphones work fine (Razer Krakens in Mercury White if you are interested).

I was still having weird issues with DNS Resolving coming back with No Domain. Odder still was that the living room smart TV where we stream all of our content was not connecting to the various apps, either.

I decided to go back into my Router Settings and remove some firewall features like Port Scan Detection. That solved that problem, but not my Steam/Battle.Net game launcher problem.

I decide, this morning, to do some more changes to my Router Settings. I disabled IPv6, lowered my IPv4 firewall setting from Medium to Low and enabled uP2P. Suddenly everything works just dandy.

My surmise is that this is a hardware and software issue. I think the Firewall setting in Windows 10 Pro weren't playing nice with my router and its firewall settings. The settings were fine for Windows 10 Home, but not Pro.

Hopefully this story allowed someone to learn something about troubleshooting a problem and it has a happy ending."

It also happens like I said playing very low demanding games like terraria (just once though) and while I have nothing opened besides iTunes and maybe chrome or discord (only once or twice). The only other time that made sense was when I hit 16 gbs of ram when playing The Division 2 and had chrome, discord, and iTunes opened. I do have mismatching RAM as you can see in my parts list which I am about to change. This really only started happening about a month after getting my [2070](https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-geforce-rtx-2070-gv-n2070wf2-8gd/p/N82E16814932160?Item=N82E16814932160) which I got about 2 months ago. Before I had started monitoring temps of when it happens my CPU temps have been pretty good at around 50-55 degrees and gpu at around 70-80 for more demanding games. For less demanding games, CPU has been at around 45-50 or maybe even less and GPU has been at around 60-70, maybe even as low as 55. My GPU I think does have high idle temps because as I am writing this with only discord, chrome and MSI afterburner opened it says I am at 49 degrees but when I am gaming I think those temps are fine. I really have no idea of why this could be happening because it is so random. Any and all help is greatly appreciated. Below is my valley benchmark, part list, and userbenchmark.

Valley Benchmark Score of 5142 with max temps at around 75 and min at about 68.

I am a console gamer mostly, I have a gaming PC but use it mostly to play single player games and leave all my online gaming on console. My gaming group has all decided to move to pc, with everything being cross play we figure its time. Problem for me is I cant ever really get the feel for the movement on a keyboard.

Might just be I have big hands and fat ole fingers but I just am not as good on a keyboard as a controller, I know plugging in a game pad into a computer will take away aiming advantage of using a mouse and might as well go back to console lol.

Anyone else ever experience this? If so how did you get past it? I've thought about getting a joystick type thing for movement but not sure how effective that will be.

Any help appreciated."

talesfromtechsupport,"Not exactly a qualified technician, but I do know quite a bit about PCs.

One time I received a message from my friend, telling me that his little brother screwed up his gaming rig. The PC was a hand-me-down from his father, costing around \~$2500 in 2007ish. For its time the rig was a beast. Rocking a QX6800, 6 gigs o ram, and 2 GTX 275s in SLI. Note that this was in 2019, so the rig wasn't exactly up-to spec anymore.

I asked him what was screwed up, and he told me that when he went back into his room, he saw that his PC was stuck in a boot loop.

So I went to his home, took the PC to the living room, opened it up. Re-seated the RAM, no change, checked the CPU socket, no bent pins. Went through most of the steps, no change.

Then I went into the BIOS and lo and behold, his brother had somehow set the CPU multiplier to 13, had set the FSB to 300 or something, vcore to 1.6v (note that this was above the safe voltage specified by Intel). The mobo was a cheapo, VRMs were barely able to handle the QX6800's 130w TDP, so the poor VRMs were cooking. Luckily I fixed it before anything bad happened to the PC.

Then I realized that it was a ASUS mobo, and googling the model number gave me a list of specs.

One piece of software that caught my eye was ASUS Ai Suite. He had it installed, and used to it set ""power modes"". It could also change advanced settings, like the FSB and multiplier. So his brother went and messed with the settings and pressed apply, the PC restarted.

Told him to lock the PC when he isn't in the same room as the PC.

# EDIT: For those who think that the title refers to a modern system, it does not. It refers to a 2007 rig.

talesfromtechsupport,"Evening all,

So this tale goes back to my days on the support department, I had only been in the job for around 9 months when the following events took place:

**$Me -** IT installation technician of 3 years

**$AngryCust-** The individual on the other end of the call

>**$Me:** Hi thank you for calling TMUK IT, how can I help?  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** Hi, I logged a ticket ages ago as my Outlook is slow, I need you to look into it ASAP  
>  
>**$Me:** Of course, let's get remoted on \*Opens up RMM, launches Outlook\*  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** I need this sorting ASAP, my PC should run faster than this, I can't work  
>  
>**$Me:** \*Sees massive Outlook recycling bin, I mean, this bin was huge\*  
>  
>**$Me:** It seems like your Outlook is quite slowed down due to the amount of mailboxes you have open, your recycling bin is quite full too. Do you need all these mailboxes open?  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** I need to keep ALL these mailboxes open (We are looking at 10 mailboxes here) as I use them to monitor my staff. Do something else to make it faster  
>  
>**$Me:** Okay, we will clean up the recycle bin then and archive off some emails, are you happy with that?  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** I must have access to ALL my emails, I can't open archives  
>  
>**$Me:** Okay then, I'll go ahead and clean the bin  
>  
>\*Deletes bin contents  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** That's a little better, thanks \*ends call\*

&#x200B;

Around an hour passed

&#x200B;

>**$Me:** Hi, hows the compute-  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** YOU'VE DELETED ALL MY EMAILS  
>  
>**$Me:** I'm sorry, can you show me whe-  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** THEY'RE ALL GONE, WHERE HAVE YOU PUT THEM  
>  
>**$Me:** I only deleted the ones in the bin  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** WELL THEY'RE ALL GONE, THIS IS £10,000 of WORK, I WILL NEED RENUMERATION  
>  
>**$Me:** Apologies but I have only deleted the emails in this bin \*Shows customer recycle bin\*  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** That's where I keep my archived emails!!  
>  
>**$Me:** I offered to make you an archive which you refused  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** Well this worked until YOU went on my PC  
>  
>**$Me:** The recycle bin is not permanent storage, if you stored your filing cabinet in your recycling bin and then left the bin out would you be angry at the bin man for collecting them?  
>  
>**$AngryCust:** I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR BOSS, NOW

&#x200B;

After about 5 minutes of the angry customer speaking to my boss the phone was put down and I was told not to worry, I never actually found out what happened to the customer. I never really spoke to them again or saw them at the site when I visited. I can only presume they must have got confused between their desk and a recycle bin

TL;DR: Customer's Outlook was slow due, I cleaned their recycle bin, turns out customer recycle bin was their version of an archive"
talesfromtechsupport,"A couple of weeks ago a ticket comes in, a phishing attempt has been reported by a user.  The source email says it's coming from another user (User Zero from now on) in the company.  I check Barracuda and sure enough, the email source is from User Zero, I run the cleanup, deleting emails from mailboxes, emailing everyone about the phishing email and then call User Zero and leave a voicemail saying that they need to change their password.

A second ticket comes in for the same issue, email back saying that we're rectifying the issue, delete email, change password if you clicked on the link and entered your credentials.

At this point I check who User Zero is.  They're an account manager (sales) out of one of our other offices.  I consider disabling the account as a scream test when ticket 3 shows up.  This time it's from the manager at User Zero's location.  User Zero is out on medical leave so he can't be working so they suspect a compromised account.

At this point I change User Zero's password and go into Azure to see what I can find.  Sign in attempts show in the last 24 hours a bunch of sign ins from Lagos Nigera and the UK.  I expand the results to the last month and my jaw dropped.  More Nigerian logins, more from the UK, a few Russian ones and a handful from the Ukraine.

User Zero calls me, he's gotten the messages and he's changing his password as we speak.  I let him know what happened and he's happy but frustrated over his customers getting phished.  Everything's taken care of and we say our goodbyes.

For some reason the Director of IT was in his office.  Which was unusual because 1) it was close to 4pm and 2) he's been WFH for 2 months now and I've been back in the office for 2 weeks after WFH.  I let him know what happened, he asks me to write up a report so he can inform the higher ups of the breach and what happened and the risks.

I send the email out and copy in my coworker, the AD/O365 primary admin (I'm his backup).  He then sends back a scary report.  Over 50 users have questionable sign ins from China, Nigeria, Turkey, India, Ukraine.

This leads to us force resetting a bunch of passwords, letting our Help Desk know who is going to call and what to do.  My coworker may look into upgrading our Azure AD plan so we can have the automatic monitoring.

I just got an email today from my coworker, one of the people we force reset has odd sign ins again."
talesfromtechsupport,"I support a line of industrial equipment that has uses over a wide range of industries. The company I work for actually has several semi-related lines of equipment. While I do know the general concepts behind several of them, the only one I am trained in and know even the basics of how to run is the one that I support. 

One day as I’m sitting at my desk answering emails, I get a call from a certain customer (Kevin). He was struggling with the software related to my line of equipment and needed help getting it working. I start with some of the basic troubleshooting questions, on/off, etc. but no dice. Once the easy things to do are done, I ask him to do something a bit more involved at which point it becomes clear he is not actually at the computer in question. He is at his desk and there is no phone near the equipment’s computer. He had been having one of the technicians run into the room with the computer and do what I asked. I ask if I can remote into the computer. It is not connected to the internet. I ask if he can use his cell near the computer or if there can be a phone connected to that room. He says the IT department will not put a phone there or connect the computer to the internet and that his phone does not get signal in that room. 

At this point I say the magic words that have always convinced customers that maybe they can talk to their IT about solutions. 

$Me: “Well, if you do not want me to fix this over the phone or by remote for free, the only other option is that you pay for me to come out and fix it. Our rate is (awful amount)/hour plus travel costs which in your case would include the flights, car rental, and two nights in a hotel. I can get you a quote if you like.”

$Kevin: “That would be great! Send the quote and I’ll get it approved. By the way, we are also having trouble with #otherlineofequipment. Do you think you can look at that while you are here?”

$Me: “I have no training on and will not be able to do anything with #otherlineofequipment. If I come to your workplace I will only work on #mylineofequipment. Do you still want a quote?”

$Kevin: “Yes, that will be fine. I’ll work on fixing #otherlineofequipment with your co-worker Jenny.”

$Me: “Sounds good. I’ll prepare the quote.”

Now that I know that Kevin knows Jenny I decide to see what I’ve gotten myself into.

$Me: “Hey, Jenny. I’m about to go to Customer’s site to help out with #mylineofequipment issues. What do you know about these guys?”

$Coworker: “Oh great! I’ve sent them (super simple, step-by-step) directions (that a 10 year old could follow) on how to fix their issue with #otherlineofequipement a couple times, but they keep refusing to try it so I’ve been refusing to go fix it. Would you mind giving it a try while you are there?”

$Me: “Looks like you are a smarter person than me. Um...if there is time I guess I can give it a shot.”

Once all the paperwork is out of the way, I set up my flights, bring a printed set of directions from Jenny and head to “sunny” Placeville. 

After reaching the site and checking in, Kevin brings me to the equipment. The first thing that I notice is that about 3 feet away from the computer is a telephone. The second thing that I notice is that there are two friendly technicians named Tech1 and Tech2 who actually do the day to day. 

$Kevin: “Me, glad you are here! I hope you’ll be able to fix our problems with #otherlineofequipment. It’s really been slowing us down. This is Tech1 and Tech 2. They are the ones who actually use the equipment.”

$Tech1: “I’m definitely excited to have #otherlineofequipment back at its usual efficiency.”

$Tech2: “Yep.”

$Me: “As I said in my emails earlier, I do not know anything about #otherlineofequipment and have never used it in any capacity. I have not even turned one on at any point. I will happily fix your issues with #mylineofequipment, but when it comes to #othelineofequipment I have no knowledge that will help and can only call the same help phone number that you do. I have brought with me the instructions that Coworker has sent to you before, so if there is time I will try and follow that. That is the extent of what I can and will do for you.”

$Kevin: “I’ll be in my office if you need me. Thanks for looking at #otherlineofequipment!”

$Tech1: “We were having problems with #mylineofequipment?”

$Tech2: “Oh yeah, we had some small file issue that I had a workaround for. It would be nice to not have to use the workaround.”

$Me: “I’ll start with that.”

After considerable fighting with their local IT over whether or not software installation requirements really are required, I was able to get #mylineofequipement back up and running correctly. At this point I could have taken lunch, but there were no restaurants close and I was hating being there, so I went straight for fixing #otherlineofequipment. Following the directions from Jenny was easy enough and got the equipment 90% fixed. I called Jenny, who lead me through the next steps and thought I was done. 

$Me: “OK, well, that’s about it. If you could fill out this paperwork saying I was here I’ll get going.”

$Kevin: “Actually, the problems with #otherlineofequipment started when the original software became corrupted. Could you transfer the files for the equipment parameters to the new PC? I don’t recall what the parameters were and don’t have a record because I had an intern set it all up 7 years ago.”

$Me: “I’ll take a quick look.”

The parameters were completely corrupt, so I was finally able to leave. And that is the story of how something that should have taken about an hour and been free cost my customer many hours and a few thousand dollars. 


Epilogue: I also found out that all the parameters for #mylineofequipment were set up by that same intern. In other words, a highly paid “engineer” knew nothing about the process, what different signals in their equipment meant, or how to run the equipment in the slightest. Supervising the techs who ran this equipment was this person’s entire job. I’m not sure what he did with his time. The cherry on top: weeks later I learned that their finance department was refusing to pay because the bill was lower than the quote. It took several phone calls and an email asking if they would prefer to pay for hours not worked before they finally paid up."
talesfromtechsupport,"As much as I enjoy the stories of the tech-illiterate masses, you have to remember there's a different side to it.

Some years ago at I place I worked at we had some problems with a fairly niche specialty sensor.

Damn thing wouldn't give us a signal.

So we did a lot of troubleshooting ourselves, wipped out the oscilloscope and did a bunch of testing to no result.

So we compiled a E-Mail to the generic support@[company].com of the manufacturer which included oscilloscope screen caps, a wiring diagrams and our previous troubleshooting.

Next day at the beginning of the shift we had a answer of the goddamn lead-engineer that developed the sensor.

It was something like:

""Yep we had the same issue during development, you have to seperate power and signal ground and the explosion-environment version of the sensor you're using needs a higher supply voltage.""

I was genuinely amazed.

And at night I still dream about a world where everybody can communicate issued like that in a precise technical language."

Several days later the new charger turned up and worked fine and to this day I remind her that just because two ends look the same, it does not make it so"
talesfromtechsupport,"I got recommended here by a friend who thinks the world needs to hear my stories from when I worked as a laptop technician. I'm new to Reddit so be patient with me lol.

This story took place about a year into the job. I started working in the repair shop as counter staff, but got bumped to assistant manager and then technician, so I often found myself alternating roles wherever I was needed on the day. One summer day I'm about to clock out and go on my lunch break when a customer comes in with a laptop. She seemed pretty pissed off, so I held back to help her out as my work colleagues were all with other customers. This customer quickly turned into a Karen within minutes.

**$Me:** Hi how can I help you :D

**$Karen:** I bought this stupid laptop a few days ago from here and it already stopped working. It's my son's laptop so I need it looked at immediately.

The repair shop was pretty big, so we also did a lot of business selling second-hand phones/tablets/laptops, as well as a bunch of different accessories. Immediately I recognize the laptop she's brought in as I was the one who had prepared it to be sold earlier that week. A very distinct bright blue HP (can't remember what model it was but doubt it matters) Immediately my gut instinct tells me this is a sus situation.

**$Me:** So what kind of problems are you having with the machine?

**$Karen:** My son only used it for a few days, and then it started slowing down and now doesn't work at all.

**$Me:** That's no problem, I'll help you out here at the counter and try to resolve the issue for you quickly.

I open the machine up at the counter and the os is completely destroyed. Corrupted shortcuts on the desktop, the machine is crashing whenever I'd try to open file explorer, command prompt, etc. My standard guess in this situation would be a hard drive failure, but I had installed a brand new hdd in the machine, so this situation screamed like Karen isn't telling me the whole story. I was on the job long enough to trust my instincts with customers, and seeing as I was the last person to touch the machine before her I knew it was almost definitely one of two options. Either A: both the lab as well as me missed something which was very unlikely. Or B: The customer damaged the machine and is trying to play it off like it's our fault. I wasn't about to make any assumptions, but this customer had an attitude, a kind that's very distinct from the usual frustrated customer, an attitude you'd only get from customers who were ready to start a fight.

I explain to Karen what I can see on her desktop, and that this kind of problem can only be resolved once the technician has taken a proper look. I explain our book in procedure, that we will take in the machine and test it, and then call her within 24 hours with an update on what we've found. Unsurprisingly shes huffing over having to leave the machine in the shop. When booking in a repair like this we take a full report from the customer of what had occurred, in case we need to build a case for any reason, so I get to asking her some standard questions.

**$Me:** So when did you start noticing these problems with the machine?

**$Karen** Only this morning when I turned it on, it was fine last night.

**$Me:** You mentioned your son uses the machine, did he mention noticing anything wrong at any time over the past few days?

The mentioning of her son set Karen off and she starts snapping in front of all the other customers. I know I've hit a nerve here and her son is involved in this story somehow.

**$Karen:** My son is none of your concern! You are dealing with me here!

Now the aim of the game here with a wild Karen is to calm her quickly, as any provocation could set her off into a wild rampage. Using my ""amazing"" charm I explain to Karen that I understand her frustration, but for me to properly assess the damages and help her I need to know how the machine has been used. She calms and starts complying.

**$Karen:** My son rarely used the machine, I only gave it to him for a few hours to play his games.

**$Me:** Can I ask what games those where?

**$Karen:** Only Minecraft and Roblox. He's too young to know how to do anything himself.

Now I know this woman is either clueless or lying to my face, as I can clearly see the Steam launcher on the desktop, as well as a bunch of other scattered games and game folders. So I decide to test her story.

**$Me:** Ma'am I'm just going to ask you a few questions about what I can see here. Do you know what steam is?

**$Karen:** No.

**$Me:** And have you ever heard of any of the following programs: Warthunder, TF2, etc. etc.

**$Karen:** No. No. No.

**$Me:** Okay ma'am if you will give me one minute I would just like to take your hard drive into the back and run a quick scan to see what other data I can see.

She gives permission, so I take the laptop in the back and plug the hdd into our system, and find exactly what I was expecting. The local disk has been completely destroyed, assumedly by her son. Half installed game folders everywhere. Files pulled out of (x86) and dumped on the desktop, in the recycle bin. This kid has even pulled folders out of what I assume is (Windows) and done the same, thrown pieces of the os at random around the local disk. Now I don't suspect she did any damage herself, but it's evident someone deliberately fucked the laptop, likely her son. She clearly knows this and is trying to play the issue off like this damage was there from when we sold her the machine. I show the damage to the other technician who works with me and he agrees with my assumption. Now comes the tricky part, confronting the beast. The two of us go out to Karen and explain what we have found.

**$Me:** Ok, so I opened up your files in the back and have found the issue causing your problems.

We pull up screenshots we made in the back and show them to Karen on our tablets in the front of the store. We proceed to explain what she is looking at, and that this damage was caused by someone moving files and possibly deleting portions of the os. Pointing out evidence that conflicted with Karen's story sent her into a fiery rage against me and the technician.

**$Me:** Is there any chance your son may have done this damage, could you have left him alone with the machine at any point?

**$Karen:** How dare you call me a Liar! my son would have never have done this, and neither have I! You're clearly trying to push your own errors on to me! I want a refund!

**$Me:** Ma'am I am not calling anyone a liar, I can only make assessments based on the evidence I have here. What I know is that the damage caused to your laptop was done by a person, and I know this damage was not present when the laptop was put up for sale earlier this week. We take screenshots and full reports of all devices before they are put out for sale. Regardless of who caused this damage, this voids your warranty on the machine, and you are not eligible for a refu-

**$Karen:** Give me the owner's number right now! I am going to get you punished for your rudeness!

**$Me:** Ma'am I legally cannot give you the owner's private number. If you want you can leave your own number, and I can have him call you the next time he is in the store. For now all I can do is book in your machine and have the technician assess it for you.

**$Karen:** Then get me your manager! You are not getting out of talking to me like this!

**$Me:** Ma'am I am the manager on site right now. Again, I am sorry for this inconvenience but all I can do for you is book in your machine for an assessment and repair.

Seeing that neither of us are budging to her raged screaming, Karen falters to the pressure. She shifts into a passive-aggressive mood and has me book in her laptop for a repair, all while I maintain my standard happy composure to the customer. I hand her the repair docket and wish her a nice day. She storms out of the building. I wasted 30 minutes of my lunch break helping a Karen -\_\_- But the salt was  too much not to pass up on

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: Karen claims I sold her a faulty machine, I show her evidence that her son damaged the machine. She calls me a liar and loses her shit.

(I get that I may seem pretty biased against Karen in my assumptions, but this is my telling of the story now after looking back on everything, filling in and compressing info to cut down on the 30 plus minute dialogue with her. I give every customer the benefit of the doubt until I have evidence that says otherwise)

Edit: Holy shit 2k upvoted already, thanks for the warm welcome to the sub :D

Edit 2: Silver as well? I've no fucking clue how medals even work but thank you stranger. You've convinced me to keep posting my stories :D

Also I wanted to address some of the repeating comments I've seen. Since we are an IT repair shop primarily, we treat the software and hardware warranty as two separate warranties. She voided her software warranty but the hardware was undamaged and still covered. All repairs are given a warranty as well, so she was covered for both sw and hw at the end of it, albeit a considerably shorter warranty now on the sw.

Secondly, some of you pointed out the unlikelihood that it was a HP machine. I did some research and you're most likely right. I've no idea why I remembered it as a HP, I only mentioned the distinct colour of it to emphasize the short space of time between it leaving the store and coming back within the week destroyed."
talesfromtechsupport,"When I was in college, I worked a walk-up IT job at a university library, where patrons could walk up with tech related problems (I use 'tech' very loosely here) and we would do our best to fix them. One time a known problem user came to us unable to add his email account to a new iPhone. I had been warned about this particular patron, but until then I had had mildly pleasant interactions with him - usually harmless banter when he would come by with a problem. This time he had a haircut scheduled, so he dropped his phone off with us to add the account so that it would be done by the time he got back.

As soon as he left I realized that I wouldn't be able to finish adding the account until he got back, because one of the steps requires entering the account password, which he hadn't left with us (and as a matter of practice, patrons usually wouldn't). So about 45 minutes later he comes back to pick up his phone, and I tell him we'll be done in just a minute and could he please enter his password so I can finish adding the account. He asks why I need the password and I explain that it's just part of the steps needed to add a new mail account to his phone. He then says that is in fact not what he needed help with. As it turns out, either I misunderstood what he has asked when he dropped the phone off, or he didn't explain it well - either way, there was a miscommunication and he actually needed something else done (can't quite remember now, I think he maybe needed a calendar imported from one of his mail accounts or something). So I apologize for having jumped the gun and assuming I understood his request, and then said without thinking

""But I guess you know what they say about when you assume!""

(the standard response I know being ""it makes an ass out of 'U' and 'me'). After a sudden and uncomfortable silence, he says quite coldly ""I don't think I've been made an ass of here"", taking the completed version of the adage quite literally. The interaction was so immediately uncomfortable. It took a bit to figure out exactly what he wanted, and in that time my boss came out from the back to check on things, when this patron promptly informed him that I had implied he was an ass. My boss, trying to save face, apologizes profusely and takes over adding the account. I got a talking to after, even though this guy was known to be problematic.

I have not used that saying since and whenever I see it I am reminded of easily one of the more uncomfortable encounters on the job. That job was a good one, especially for a student, but I sure am glad I don't work there anymore."
talesfromtechsupport,"Hey all,

So as I do a brain dump of all the trials and tribulations I have been through in my young IT career I thought this one might perk the interest of some people. Let's set the scene.....

**$Me** \- Young support tech, 5 months on the job at the time

**$Cust** \- Customer who is an ""IT Manager"" (Really they are the office manager but..... many hats right?)

**$ExTech -** Technician who as dealt with **$Cust** several times before

So it's about 11AM and I pick up the call queue...

>**$Me:** Hey, you've reached TMUK support, how can I help

>**$Cust:** Hi, I bought a monitor this week, it's brand new and my laptop isn't working with it. It needs fixing ASAP

>**$Me:** Sure, we can sort that. So, just to confirm the monitors all plugged in with the blue cable, power cable and that it's turned on?  
>  
>**$Cust:** Of course it is, everything is connected and switched on  
>  
>**$Me**: Great, and on the computer can right click on the desktop and go to display settings

TL;DR: Customer connected display to D-Sub cable and power but did not connect other end of D-Sub cable to laptop as it is ""Wireless"". Customer was shocked to find laptops that are ""Wireless"" do in-fact need wires to connect to things"
talesfromtechsupport,"Y'all, this is going to be a long one that I am sure all of you or at least most of you can relate to, and will most likely bring up some deeply forgotten mental trauma.

TL;DR at the bottom

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

\- We use ConnectWise as an RMM. 

\- The user is in quarantine at a local hotel. Internet is trash, but workable. 

\- User is in the ballpark of 8,000 years old and has troglodyte-level knowledge of computers.

Me: ME

User: USER

A ticket came in from one of the higher ups for one of our larger clients requesting that we call USER and help him access their accounting web portal.

\*Call Number 1\*

Me: Hey is this USER? Hi my name is ME with COMPANY NAME REDACTED calling to give you a hand with UNNAMED ACCOUNTING WEB PORTAL

User: Can I call you back in 5 mins, I am finishing up a teleconference

Me: That's fine, I have the next hour blocked out to assist you with this and my next phone apt isn't until 3:30pm. End of call

\*30 minutes later my phone rings with USER's number on the CID\*

Me: Hey USER, are you ready to get going on this issue?

User: Yeah, sorry about that. I finished the call and tried to catch the end of a movie on the TV, got distracted.

Me: (Already rubbing temples) No worries, do you know the name of your computer?

User: Uhhh yeah, it's \*proceeds to read the brand and model\*

Me: Uh no I need the laptop name, should be a sticker on the hand rest with the name?

User: Nothing there, how can I find it

Me: \*Walks user through 4 different ways to find the name: hostname, control panel, system information, about this PC\* Do you see the name?

User: Uhhhhhh \*long pause of dead air with a deep sigh after\* no, it says web results for hostname

Me: \*Walks user through the other 3 different ways I mentioned again\* What do you see now?

User: \*ANOTHER OVER EXAGGERATED DEEP SIGH\* I don't see anything, it just keeps telling me web results for whatever I type

Me: \*Trying my hardest to keep cool\* Okay, type control panel

User: K \*SIGH\* done

Me: What do you see?

User: The box just says Control Panel with the cursor flashing

Me: \*Contemplating fully loaded Russian Roulette\* Press enter

User: Okay now it just shows me a bunch of icons

Me: Click on the one that says system

User: Okay the computer name says Intel Core i5

Me: Below that \*Internal Screaming\*

User: 16 GB

Me: Further below that, you should see a section that says computer name

User: OH, well why didn't you just say that! It's COMPUTERNAME-19 

PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE NAME HE GAVE

Me: \*Searches RMM list of computers\* Alright I don't see that on here, lets get a remote session going

Me: \*Gives very specific instructions\* Okay now you are going to want to open Edge

User: What is Edge

Me: Do you see a blue E on your desktop

User: Yeah it's there

Me: Double Click

User: Okay now what

Me: Type in the address bar [help.REDACTED.com](https://help.REDACTED.com)

User: Okay I have search results

Me: No, in the address bar type [help.REDACTED.com](https://help.REDACTED.com)

User: Same as before, search results

Me: \*Sincerely calling an old folks home to come get an escaped denizen\* Alright, I am going to email you EXACTLY what I need you to type in that address bar

\*Email sent to user\*

User: Alright I got it and typed it in but I am still getting search results

Me: Are you typing it into a search bar or the address bar

User: Search bar

Me: \*Vibrating from pure anger\* I need you to type that into the address bar

User: Oh, well why didn't you just say that in the first place! \*Website pulled up properly\* Okay now what?

Me: \*Gives EXTREMELY specific steps SLOWLY for how to download and run the agent\*

User: Surprisingly follows the instructions with minor errors

This part doesn't really have conversation, just more pure rage that I am sure is going to send me further down the rabbit hole of depression. Remember the name of the laptop that the user gave? Here's where that comes in, mind you, this call is already at the 40 minute mark so I am 20 minutes late for my next call:

Me: Alright now that you can access [REDACTED.com](https://REDACTED.com) for your accounting work, I am going to put our remote agent on the laptop so we don't have to repeat this process

User: \*Continuously moves mouse preventing me from doing my work\*

Me: Can you please stop moving the mouse, it prevents me from doing my work. \*Starts the install of the custom agent meant specifically for this client\*

User: Oh my bad, won't happen again sir \*Near Nuclear Levels of Sarcasm\*

Me: No worries, let me just make sure this install goes through without fault

Suddenly, a wild warning pops up on the screen ""LabTech agent installation has failed for the following reasons: Agent is already installed at this location

Me: \*Confusion intensifies\*

I went back to the system page to find, low and fucking behold, that USER added a 1 in front of the number in the name of the laptop. The actual name? COMPANYNAME-9. Take a wild guess what was already in ConnectWise and invalidated 90% of the pain and frustration I just suffered? You guessed it, USER's laptop

Me: \*Blacking Out from the Near-Toxic Levels of BRUH I was Experiencing\* Alright USER looks like you're good to go, take care and have a great quarantine!

Now, I am going to go drink myself into a mindless trance and hopefully repress this hellish memory so that I can relive it tomorrow with another geriatric that someone let have a computer.

TL;DR: Escaped nursing home resident destroys my mental state with this one neat trick!"
talesfromtechsupport,"Gotta rant on this one:

So my last call of the day today was a doctor at an office we sold 3 systems to a couple months back, and he immediately starts laying into me:

DrKevin (obligatory not his name):
‘It’s been nothing but problems since we purchased this system, you guys fix it and it breaks a day later... we spent thousands of $ on a system that doesn’t work... were losing thousands of $ cuz we can’t take X-rays.. etc.’

Then he tells me to call the office back in 5 mins to talk to his assistant. Awesome, dude literally just wanted to complain. 

So I call the office immediately cuz otherwise I’d risk getting another call and not be able to call out at all, and after explaining that to the bitchy receptionist who said ‘doc told you to call back in 5 mins’ she put me on hold. While waiting i peruse the notes for all 3 offices. 

Not even joking, 100% of the calls we’ve logged that were actual issues are user related and/or Network related. As software we support, we don’t manage anything with network. We ping, flushdns, and tell users to enter their network creds. That’s about the extent of what we’re allowed to do because.. well, *SOFTWARE* support. Period. 

Examples of the calls?

- client workstation won’t connect to the database. Server is 192.168.1.x and client is 10.1.10.x. Entirely different networks. ‘But you guys fixed it just the other day!’ Note from that day reads my colleague chose the correct office WiFi and you entered the password. ‘It is the right WiFi!’ Then I don’t know what to tell you. Call your IT. 
- IT called us because the office is saying they can’t take xrays, admits that they’ve been in process of overhauling their network. Thru discussion, it’s determined the can’t connect to the device because they *removed* the router that enables the device to connect, didn’t think it served any purpose. Ignorance is bliss. Can’t blame em too much for not knowing, but I truly don’t understand the umpteen calls we got after we clearly explained the purpose of the router, all related to the router not being present. 
- last Thursday, office calls cuz they can’t take xrays. Tech has caller reboot the panel. After 3 reboots with no change, it’s discovered caller is rebooting the *wrong thing*. She pushes the right button and they’re back in business. 

Which leads me to my call today. Same chick from last Thursday, and not surprisingly, exact same reason for calling. Device isn’t powered on. She *admits* it was exactly what she went thru on Thursday. Then asks, ‘could it be my iWatch? Cuz they didn’t have any problems before I started filling in here, I normally work at the other office...’ no Karen, you’re iWatch has nothing to do with the power button. 

So she powers it on, and it immediately powers itself back off after displaying a low battery. ‘Ok, switch the batteries, Karen’. Then all is good. 

Then Karen asks, ‘I took xrays today can you get them back?’ Of note: this particular IR does have internal storage, but: ‘no Karen, the device was off when you took the images. There’s literally nothing can be done about that.‘

AND THEN she asks, ‘so how can we prevent this issue?’ 

.....
.........
I.....

.... I can’t even.....

oh yeah, you bet your ass I told my boss to let sales know to deny *ANY AND EVERY* demand for refunds or discounts cuz the way the doc was talking, I feel it coming. 

TL;DR: doc complains he bought a shoddy system when it is *readily* apparent that all issues stem *directly* from users and office IT."
talesfromtechsupport,"This wont be a very long post, but as a bit of background I work at a printer repair/delivery/setup company and we deal with quite a few calls, but this one made me laugh a little bit. 

I got a call in my queue for a set up scan to email.  

Now since this was set up a few months earlier this would now be a charge call, but I delivered this machine and clearly remember their IT Department requested that we do NOT set up scan to email. 

So I called the customer,

Me:  Good morning I am calling about your scan to email issue.

Her: Yeah, you guys forgot to set up scan to email when you delivered this machine, I have to have scan to email for me to work. 

Me: I understand ma'am,  I was the one who set up the machine, and I was instructed by your IT Department not to set up scan to email, and that scan to folder would be more then enough. 

Her: Well that's unacceptable I need it to work can you set it up?  

Me:  Well I would need to speak with the IT Department to set up scan to email, would you be able to transfer me to them so I can speak with them about this?

Her: I'll give them a call and call you back. *click*

Me, expecting this to be over, tells dispatch what happened, and we laugh a bit. Then about 5-10 minutes later I get a call back.

Her: Hey I called my IT guy and be said it's fine, can you set it up?

Me:  Alright, would I be able to speak with them, I need some information from them so I can set it up.

Her: What do you not believe me?

Me: Its not that ma'am, I just need the SMTP information and mail server settings so I can get it set up.  

Her: You're making things up, you dont need that, I want you to set up scan to email on my printer now. 

Me: Ma'am, I apologize for the inconvenience but I still need to discuss that with your IT Department because this would be a charge call if I set this up, and they will need to know why there is a charge in addition to giving me the required information. If you feel this is inadequate I can transfer you to my supervisor. 

Her: It shouldn't be a charge call, it was supposed to be set up when you installed it. 

Me looking at the email that says otherwise:  No ma'am, it says not to set that up. I have it here, that ""if IT decides later to set up scan to email they will set it up themselves and has the option to call us for support"", so if we are going to support setting it up they will have to pay for support.

Her: Well, I guess I'll give them a call.


I followed up by calling dispatch again to let them know, and gave a heads up to my manager in case she calls, and about 15-20 minutes I get another call from her.

Her:  Hey I called them and they agreed can you set it up. 

(I know she didnt, but I have no other calls at the moment, so oh well...) 

Me: That's great, did they give you the SMTP server information I requested?

Her:  Oh you think you are so clever?

Me: I'm sorry?

Her: You think I am going to fall for you trying to trick me into telling you I didnt call IT dont you?

Me (Holding back laughter):
No ma'am, you need the smtp server information so you can set up scan to email.

Her: Well, I need it to work, and IT approved it so do it.

Me: Alright ma'am, do you mind if I put you on hold for a moment?

Her: No, I do mind.  (This is what she said)


I called my manager to get the ITs number and gave them a call.  

Me: Hey IT Head, this is ME, I am calling about this person who wants to set up scan to email on the printer we set up. 

IT:  Yeah, no we aren't doing that, and neither are you. She is wrong and I need to speak with her apparently.  

Me: well I have her on hold and can let you speak to her now.

IT: Perfect go ahead. 


So I combine the calls...

Me: alright ma'am, I am here with your IT Department Head, and he wanted to talk about how you aren't allowed to have scan to email...

IT: Yeah, you aren't having scan to email, you have scan to folder.  If you need to email it you can attach it to the email afterwards.  If you try this again you will be locked out of our systems, and will lose your job.  We do not play with the security of our systems.  Any questions?

Her:  I am the manager of this location and I am telling you I need this.

IT: No you dont need it. If you need it we dont need you.  I have your supervisor on speed dial if you want to discuss this with him.

And the moral to this story, dont go behind your ITs back."
talesfromtechsupport,"The title is self explanatory and one of my colleague dealt with this not myself.  
We provide (into other things) Tech support for various companies including games.  


This kid messages us to complain that he keeps being logged out and lose connection,  
We explain to him the usual: make sure to use a cable connection not the wifi, verify that the firewall exception is added etc and tell him that if none of the list we gave him work we will need his logs to help him.  
Kids sends back the logs, nothing seems off, connection is cabled but not super fast but should be more than enough speed-wise. Colleague tries to give him advice and support as best as possible but kid claims nothing his helping....  


And then comes the confession: the kid plugged the ethernet cable for the logs but is now back to using Wi-fi.  
Why? does he not always have access to the cable? is he forced to use the wifi? No he just plainly does not wanna use it and insists he wants to use is wifi and surprise.. after receiving the new logs his wifi is not stable, barely good enough to load a youtube video without stuttering.

And that's when he turns into an entitled kid and start to say it's our job to boost his connection, that we need to make it work for him on the wifi because he doesnt want to use the cable. He obviously refused our advice to see with his parents and isp if there was a way to get a more stable connection but obviously he did not listen.

Last i heard my coworker gave him a warning on language and closed the ticket."
talesfromtechsupport,"So I should state this is from my early days as a ""Hybrid Technician"" (Essentially a mix of support, installation and proactive maintenance). It's not great but it sticks in my mind as one of the weirder events of my career

Essentially my MSP had just sold a massive contract to a local business however in order to keep everyone happy they sold the MD of said business a brand spanking new gaming laptop and an SSD upgrade for his gaming PC. I'm sent to his house (Weird as we don't generally do personal site visits) to install it.

For the record, I get on well with the MD, he's a nice chap and is fairly down to earth

When I get there the following happened.

**$Me -** Hi, I'm here to install an SSD into **$CoolMD's** PC

**$MDWife -** Oh.... right, I'm just teaching **$MDSon1** at the moment, the PC is in the other room

**$Me** \- OkiDoki, \*Wanders to room\* and starts installing SSD

\*All of a sudden their is the sounds of two kids yelling, **$CoolMDs** voice and a dog

**$CoolMD** \- Hey, glad you came, I need this PC upgrading with the new SSD

**$Me** \- Sure thing

I head off to use the facilities only to return to the dog licking the motherboard of the computer, luckily everything is fine and I make friends with the small doggo however then the following happens. Their is however screaming in the other room as presumably **$MDSon1** wasn't happy with learning at home

**$Me -** \*Starts installing Windows 10 upgrade onto existing SSD and moving files to new SSD\*

**$MDSon2 -** \*Wonders into room\*

**$Me** \- I'm not sure you should be in here but as long as you don't touch anything it's fine, but speak to your dad first okay

\*\*$Me - \*Goes to find **$CoolMD\***

**$Me -** Erm, that's not how I left it

**$MDSon2** \- I didn't touch it

**$Me** \- Fair enough but the screen is gone and their is no installer running now and the FortNite launcher is open

**$MDSon2 -** Just leaves without saying anything

Turns out, the kid decided to bin off the file transfer and Windows 10 install so he could play fornite, effectively binning off 30 mins worth of downloads and file transfers.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - I went to customers house, customers son cancels file transfer and Windows 10 upgrade, icing on cake was dog licking motherboard and screaming coming from other room"
talesfromtechsupport,"Here's a lighthearted one for you guys.  
No angry customers or incompetent managers.

A decade and a bit ago I was working in an office doing residential internet tech support. Our NOC had just finished cleaning up... something. Server room, storage locker, I'm not really sure.  
They brought in a couple of cardboard boxes of cables into the support center (the ""tech pit"" as we called it) for anyone to scavenge anything they'd like for personal use before the contents were thrown out. It was almost entirely network cables, but I think there was a USB hub or two as well. Just odds and ends from previous projects or installations. I'm sure we all have a box like that in a cupboard or closet somewhere.

So people would get off their calls, poke around, find something that they thought they could use, and the boxes got picked through pretty quickly.  
I managed to scoop up half a dozen or so cables of various lengths.

It was the cooler time of year, but not snowing, so I had a large trench coat, with massive pockets inside, so I stuffed the cables in that for when I went home at the end of the day.

Cut to the trip home on public transit. I was taking the Skytrain (Vancouver BC). Picture a subway, but on elevated tracks instead of buried ones, and you're pretty well there.  
End up seeing an acquaintance, friend of a friend sort, and sat down for a chat since we're both going to be on the same train for the next 15 minutes or so.  
He gets to telling me about how he's just rearranged a room recently and was annoyed by having to use a 50 foot cable when his modem and router were right near each other.  
So I asked how long of a cable he needed. He said maybe a foot.  
So I reach into my jacket, pull out a foot long cable, and hand it to him.  
He said ""thanks"" like it wasn't anything abnormal and we continued chatting, all while a couple of people who overheard the conversation had really puzzled looks on their faces."
talesfromtechsupport,"First client of the day (note: I work as local support at the national HQ of a large international bank)


Client: “Is it normal that when I click in the power button in windows that it asks to restart?

Me: “How so? What do you mean?”

Client “Well of I click on the windows icon and press the power button to shut it down it also always asks me if I wanna restart, isn’t that an issue?”

Me: “No, that’s perfectly normal”

Client: “Oh okay”

She drove 75km on a Tuesday morning to ask that question. I need more coffee."
talesfromtechsupport,"This is un update for the post of the lady who did now know about CTRL+C/V, you can read that story here: https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/gpcimf/cant_even_understand_ctrlcv/

People wanted to know what happened with ""Number"" so here it goes.

Background: A few years ago, I used to work for one of the Big Four Accounting companies as an on-site tech support along with a coworker and our supervisor. when the company opened a new office location, my coworker changed to the new office to train the new guys and we will speak daily over the phone about what was happening on each location, in one of those calls he told me about a manager.

So, my coworker would tell me about different things that ""Number"" would try to pull on everybody just because she was a manger (Very important note, she was the manager for the ethics and compliance team, having around 10 employees report directly to her).

She was the stereotype of the Karens, if she asked for something and she had to wait to receive assistance from any of us she will just stand right behind you watching you and ask
Number: ""what are you doing right now?""
Number: ""and now?""
Number: ""would you be able to assist me right now?""
Number: ""what is so important that you cannot help me, I am a manager you know?"".

And one of my favorites when she needed our help precisely at 1 pm for some reason and i responded to her.
Me: ""we will not be available to assist you at that time as we have to provide training to almost 80 new joiners to the office, if you are free after 1 pm we can assist, or we can even provide you with assistance right now""
Number:""ok, thanks I’ll see you at 1 pm"".
Me: ""Like i said we cannot go there at 1 pm.""
Number: ""you know that i will your manager know about your attitude to have this be on your performance review?""



We would mostly ignore her and most of the times that did the trick, but we were also friends with some of the guys working from here so we would hear things like, that she would have her employees write the emails for her the she would later sent, if you were a woman she would treat unfairly compared to your male counter parts.
Like she would ask one of the ladies to write one of her emails and would go.
Number: ""how did you even get a job in here if you do not know how to write something so simple and basic?"".

So she goes to one of the men of the team and ask 
Number: ""hey Man, did you review these before the lady i asked her sent me the email?"" Male Employee: ""yeah i did, i did not find anything wrong.""
Number: ""ok, then it is good"".

Well to cut the story short, after many things just like that, i had the manager in my sight, i just needed a reason. and one day she comes to my office, asks for something stupid and i say ""ok, i will finish to write an email and i will go by your desk, it shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes"".

But instead of leaving, she just stands there besides me, looking at me with dead eyes, trying to intimidate me, so i ignored her, but before leaving the office she decides to ""accidently"" step on my feet with the heels of her shoes. and that was it, i went to HR. 

This was on a Wednesday, i go to HR i say ""i would like to submit a formal report against Manager"", i later found it that she had multiple complaints reported by her employees, but i guess HR waited to receive a complaint from somebody outside of the team to see if things were as bad as they have been told.

So, on Friday of that very same week i received a call from the HR partner, (one of my responsibilities as IT was to assist on the termination process of employees, disable the accounts, grab the laptop, etc etc). so the HR partner tell me ""Pave42, could you please go to the meeting room 3"", at that point i didn't know what was happening, but when i entered the room and i see ""Manager"" in the table crying, and i can still remember the taste of those tears, the taste of victory, of Karma. I knew exactly that she was being fired.

That goes to show that eventually, Karens who threaten to put you in trouble, will eventually get in more trouble than they bargained for.

TL; DR: Karen tries to intimidate me with hear dead eyes stare, gets fired instead."
talesfromtechsupport,"This happened around 2012. 

I worked in a computer lab in my university. We were required to answer users' questions and assist them in the lab. 

Our computer labs did not have photo copiers. The labs had computers, printers, and scanners. 

Characters: Me, User, background second user 

Two users came in and one came up to the desk. 

User: hi, do you have a copy machine we could use? 

Me: I'm sorry, we don't have a copy machine; but we have a scanner and printer so you can scan in your item and print it. 

User: ok 

User goes to talk to the background second user, then returns to the desk in sitting at.

User: what's a scanner. 

It was not so easy for me to try to explain this, especially with the context - without making the user feel like an idiot. But I tried my best."
talesfromtechsupport,"The recent post about Screwdriver Karen made me remember a story from the beginning of my career.

There was this one (low level) coworker who adamantly refused to change the ink cartridges in his printer because “he wasn’t qualified” (I‘m sure he just couldn’t be bothered). His colleagues had tried to show him but to no avail.

When management learned about this, they ordered me to train him and to „make it really official“, so I actually set a date, gave the guy a detailed step-by-step tutorial about ink cartridge replacement, let him change a few himself and then had him sign the official training form acknowledging he’d received and understood the instructions.

That’s one hour I‘ll never get back."
talesfromtechsupport,"Background: I used to be an on-site tech support guy along with a coworker and our supervisor/manager, the following interaction happened the Monday after a weekend floor re-structuring (teams were rearranged and people moved to different desks).

(Number as the user)

(DF as Supervisor/Manager)

Number : Hi guys, my mouse cable is way to short, I can't move it comfortably.

Me : OK, it must have been pinched or stuck by something in the cable tray under the desk, can you tell us you ID so we can go by your desk when we are free?

As a side note we were on the middle of migrating people from tower PCs to laptops, so we had everyone in the office that qualified, schedule a time for us to do the backup and walk them through the initial set up for the laptop. We were swamped, we couldn't have any delays on migrating anyone because it would've caused a chain reaction with the rest of the appointments we had that day.

Number : Can't it be now? I can use the mouse but its annoying...

DF : We can't right now, but as soon as one of us finishes an appointment early or we take our break, we'll swing by and give you a hand.

Number : (In the best Karen attitude) I needed now!!

DF : we can't help you right now as I already told.

Number : Coooooommmmeee on guys, I need it!!, I need it!!...

My coworker (standing up with a screwdriver in hand): Here you go, just bellow you desk there's one screw if you loosen it you will be able to pull the cable more, that's the best we can do right now.

(Number leaves visibly annoyed)

Her following response was an obvious:

I want to appear like I tried and keep bugging them until they just give up and come to help me

But even with her bugging us we could continue the work, leaving the office meant dealing with any stupid issue that anyone in the path to her desk had, as as soon as we leave the office every lazy number will take advantage off it and just bother us instead of calling help desk.

Number (coming back no 5 mins later): **I don't have the necessary knowledge to use a screwdriver.**

US (In complete shock for what we just heard): what??

Number : yeah, I need your help.

DF : You can't have it right now, the screwdriver is the only technician you'll have helping you at the moment, please let us keep working.

(Number leaves without the screwdriver and we start laughing and chatting about this)

How can you use that phrase, you can't use a screwdriver?? have you never used a knob in you life??.

We are 99% percent sure she just tried that to see if we would give up, but still, if you were already in your desk with the screwdriver, couldn't you just do it instead of coming back to continue bitching??

At the end of the day we went to her desk and fixed the issue.

**Some clarifications**:

1. DF was also working on the migrations so no one was available.
2. The migration was the top priority as per the instructions we got from our superiors.

**TL;DR:** User claims to don't know how to use a screwdriver to see if we would drop everything and come to her rescue."
talesfromtechsupport,"First Post, Suggestions are appreciated, Thanks.

Transformation Part 1

Here’s  a story of, oil, riches and the tedium of wrapping up billion dollar  projects. First thing you should keep in mind in oilfield is avoid the  first 10% of a project and the last 10%. This is where the major fuckups  are made and then dragged from the closet John Carpenters Vampires  style, kicking, screaming and on fire. Second never ask for a layoff.  Third … The Grass is always greener on the next site preferably  Greenfield. ( A greenfield site is brand new construction, has yet to be  commissioned, not yet violated by operators.)

In  the beginning there was the most gravy of contracts (Henceforth  referred to as Project Alpha), Money was made and spent hand over fist  by all. Alpha was partially government funded. I was there a year and a  half, and spent the last couple months winding down the site.

It  was pretty good gig, scratch that, damn good gig. I at the time was  just a lowly blue hat, bottom of the totem pole, first rodeo. Somewhere  along the line my original crew was gutted in a mid project layoff and  some dipshit’s on highs bid to make a “super” crew, the best of the best  of the best, JTF2, Seal Team 6, Captain America, except they left all  the grey matter still on the table after assembly. Basically anyone who  never spoke up if there was a problem or kept better ideas to  themselves, the brainwashed, the braindead. Leaving me in a crew of 3  including myself. Left to our own devices, no one to report to, nothing  expected, the forgotten. This was our first industrial site so knowing  no better we just kept on with what we had originally been tasked with,  put a decent day in, avoided safety meetings, filed zero paperwork, and  generally accomplished more in a day than the old crew of 8. Lies? Not a  chance, it eventually became knowledge to me that this company  expected; once all safety requirements were met, 2 hours of actual work  to be accomplished in a 10 hour day, cut the bullshit out and we were  now 4 to 5 times more efficient. The days flew by for about a week, good  times, until the great eye of Sauron turned upon us, some took notice  of a misfit crew that held a morning brief, never in the same spot, no  lead hand, no foreman, and generally didn’t hang around too long.

Following  day enter El Capitan (General Foreman: GF), I’m taking my turn rattling  off the days bulletin as fast as I can in my best auctioneers voice,  when I get a hearty “MORNING GENTLEMEN” from over my shoulder. Fuck.  Boys we’d been had.

“Mind if I join your morning brief?”

“Sure Thing El Capitan”

These  are the people that know exactly what is going on in their area or  should. Slow it down, read the bulletin like there are those present who  care. Stretch it out. Pull out the crumpled drawings we’ve been working  off of over the last week and hand them out.

GF: “Stop by my office after you task your guys” Looks at my nametag on my hard hat “Sparky\_Fig”

Damn he’s got my name now, should’ve scraped that thing off long ago.

“Wheres That?”

“West side Foremans trailer”

Little  did I know there’s over 50 supervision trailers on the west side,  narrow it down to trade specific, there’s still about 6. Wander trailer  to trailer, asking for El Capitan. Each door leads to another world.

In  one trailer the maw to hell is open, full grown men are bellowing at  each other, office supplies are reaching terminal velocity; someone  desperately fills the coffee machine (packs are ripped open with teeth  in the same manner a medic opens quickclot), a blood ritual to appease  the gods. I think someone didn’t refill the copier, I’m berated for  interrupting and stealing the hole punch. He’s not here.

Another  door, the stairs leading up to it reverberate with the roar of  laughter, company computers are tapped into parts of the interweb where  none should ever go. The coffee machine gurgles forth a thick nectar of  caffeinated ecstasy, all mugs are full, their owners sated. I’m berated  for interrupting this important use of company time and whoever the fuck  you’re looking for, He’s not here.

Another  door, ghost town, I’m berated by a non-standard company issued rodent  for leaving the coffee machine on and the fridge door closed. He’s not  here

To Be Continued...

F.I.G. = Fucking Instrument Guy"
talesfromtechsupport,"Disclaimer: this tale does not contain any IT elements, but is definitely a support tale, so please give me the benefit of doubt, because it mentions that mythical place called outside.
As I have explained in my previous posts, I am part of a big company that builds and maintains lots of $BigExpensiveParts. Think of these $BigExpensinveParts as being best described as big metal boxes (think shipping containers) filled with electronics at many various locations spread around the country. The electronics feed back signals to a blinkenlights control panel in an office in a place that you have probably never heard of. If a blinkenlight goes out a technician is dispatched (level 1 support) , then if the technician utters swear words due to an unusual situation a $troubleshooter like myself is called (think level 2 support).

Situation
we have a $BigExpensivePart that is located at the far end of a dirt track, and alongside the length of the track is / was a big brick wall. And when I say big I mean that it was nearly a mile long and the ground level on the opposite side was 6m or 20 foot higher than the dirt track. Also the opposite side of the wall formed the rear of gardens of a lot of very expensive houses.

A few months ago one of the technicians was on site performing routine maintenance work to the $BigExpensivePart and noticed that the top of the wall was leaning over a bit, and so mentioned it in his maintenance report.

When the report got to me, I decided to do a little bit of digging through the records, as we are required to have a SLA for the $BigExpensiveParts, and many tonnes of wall collapsing on top of one would seriously impact uptime.

If this was a movie this bit is where there would be a fast forward montage to skip through all of the boring meetings. The outcome of the meeting was:
Legal had confirmed that the land $BigExpensivePart, the trackway land and the retaining wall were owned by us and so were ours to maintain.
The wall was so old that it was built before the building codes for this size of structure were written, (I suspect that the signature on  the original contract might have been a dinosaur’s footprint, it was that old).
Access to the face of the wall up against the gardens had not been seen for more than 20 years.
There had been many attempts to gain access to the gardens over the years, by various staff members ringing doorbells and posting letters, always mostly unsuccessfully.

I was mulling over what to do about the risk to the $BigExpensivePart when an office based colleague walked past and showed me the latest issue of the internal company newsletter / mini magazine, which is usually so boring that I struggle to get to the end without falling asleep, but this issue had an article that the passing colleague was grumbling at. The colleague was grumbling that the execs had bought a helicopter instead of giving bigger annual bonuses to the staff.

Upon hearing the word “helicopter” I cracked an evil grin so wide that the edges of my mouth nearly joined round the back of my neck, and came up with a cunning plan.

So I filled in the forms to requisition the helicopter, with the explanation that looking at the wall was safety critical, and the letters were not working, climbing over the fences and walls could mistake us for burglars, a drone could not be used as it could not be retrieved if it crashed, so using a low flying helicopter is the only option.

Again, if this were a move, this part is where you can all nip out and get a drink, because there were lots of boring justification, health and safety, costing and other meetings that were so boring that I must have blanked out due to trauma. Anyway the outcome was that I had been granted 2 days use of the company helicopter to examine this wall.

I initially had “surprised face” that they granted me it, immediately followed by an “oh no” moment, about how was I going to do this, as this wall and $BigExpensivePart were a day’s drive from me. Luckily I knew that 2 technicians lived within half an hours drive from the closest airport.

So I set up a conference call with the 2 technicians, myself, my boss and a few hangers on.
The call went something a bit like this:
>OK gents, I have whittled down the contestants and you 2 are the finalists to win a special assignment, which is to perv and take photos in the gardens of expensive houses possibly owned by celebrities, using the company helicopter, To win your place on this assignment you just have to tell me the quickest: (pausing for dramatic effect) as many lyrics as you can to the song Wrecking Ball by Myley Cyrus.

I am sure that the other people on the call thought that I had gone mad. But I had a secret plan.
Anyway technician ‘A’ actually started singing, which caused me to laugh so he won.

From those earlier mentioned boring meetings, I discovered that the law where this took place says,  the minimum cruising height of a helicopter is 500 feet over rural areas and 1000 feet over urban areas, so there was concern about the quality of the photos that could be obtained. 

I had a sneaky idea to make the helicopter fly at 1000 feet and dangle technician from a rope so that he could get a better angle and so improved photos. Alas that bit never happened – damn pesky health and safety. /S

The flight took place with the technician inside the helicopter and many cameras were used (some internal and some externally mounted).

Afterwards, analysis of the photos showed that the images of the wall were too poor quality to accurately determine how poor condition the garden face of the wall was. So we will have to keep trying the old-fashioned posting letters and knocking on front doors method of trying to gain access

in the mean time I just have to pray that the wall does not collapse in my lifetime otherwise, I know that I will receive a call at an inappropriate time to crawl over a pile of rubble that used to be the wall to try and get the $BigExpensivePart up and running or replaced while being shouted at by management about system down time."
talesfromtechsupport,"Hey guys, it's been a while since I posted anything on here, but this happened a few days ago and I thought I'd vent a little.

I work at a support hotline of a medium-sized company. Usually my tasks revolve around checking on customers who went offline and responding to technicians who ran out of ideas on how to fix an issue. This time however, I received a message from HR. Let me recap the chat that ensued:

&#x200B;

>HR-Lady: Hi, I'm Karen (not the real name) I'm new around here and just got my Notebook for work, but it is still missing some software I need. Could you help me?  
>  
>Me: Hi Karen. I'm sorry, but I can't. You might want to talk to Anthony about this. He's the head of the IT-Department.  
>  
>HR: Anthony is on vacation. He left a note that all IT problems should be taken care of by you.  
>  
>Me: Does the Note say ""Jimmy"" by any chance? Because there's a Jimmy Neutron working in IT. I'm Jimmy Hendricks. I work in tech support.  
>  
>HR: Yes, and I need tech support right now!   
>  
>Me: That may be, but to install the software you require, you need someone with administration rights. I'm just working a student job right here. I certainly won't be able to help you in this case.  
>  
>HR: That's stupid. Why do you even work in IT, if you don't have administration rights?  
>  
>Me: I work in tech support. It's an entirely different department from IT.

&#x200B;

At this point she stopped sending messages and I thought I had gotten rid of her. However, she must have been busy in that time to find out my direct dial number, because I got a call from her minutes later. Luckily, I was smart enough to activate the record function before taking the call.

&#x200B;

>Me: This is Jimmy Hendricks, how may I help?  
>  
>HR: This is Karen. I still need that software for my Laptop!  
>  
>Me: Hi Karen. Have you tried contacting Jimmy Neutron yet?  
>  
>HR: No I have not. I want YOU to help me now!  
>  
>Me: Sorry, I can't. As I've said, I don't have admin rights, so I can't install your software. Only the guys in IT may help you in that regard.  
>  
>HR: But you are from tech support. Isn't that the same?  
>  
>Me: No, it's not. tech supprt takes care of customer issues. Everything internal is handled by IT.  
>  
>HR: But I want this software installed NOW!  
>  
>Me: It would be best if you contacted Jimmy Neutron then. His direct dial is 123.  
>  
>HR: FINE. But this is not over! You wasted my time!

&#x200B;

She hung up and contrary to her final statement, I actually thought it to be over and went back to work. About an hour later, I was called by the head of HR (Luckily, a sensible person)

&#x200B;

>HR-Head: Hey, Jimmy. Karen just complained about you wasting her time. Do you know what's up with that? I don't want to contact Steve (Head of tech support) about this.  
>  
>Me: Well, she contacted me, about software she needed installed and I explained to her, to contact Jimmy Neutron regarding this issue, but she wouldn't listen.  
>  
>HRH: Well, she said you lead her to believe you could help her.  
>  
><At this point I sent her a message with a screenshot from my chat with Karen and the recording of her phone call>  
>  
>Me: I've just sent you evidence that I did nothing of the sort.  
>  
>HRH: *-taking some time to go through it-* Well, that looks indeed like a different story entirely. I'll talk to Karen about this, don't worry.

I haven't heard from Karen since then, but I'll be sure to give an update, if anything happens.

Edit: Since I didn't clarify this and some people were asking: I work at customer support at a company that provides WiFi for other businesses. That's why support and IT are separate departments."

talesfromtechsupport,"Background:

A few years ago I used to work for one of the Big Four Accounting companies as an on-site tech support along with another guy and our supervisor, company decided to open a new office and I was transferred there as someone with experience to train the new guys hired for that location. After a few months, we've been sharing stories with the other office of how dumb the numbers (the way we called users) were in the new office.

The first day that my coworker from the main office visited I had the following interaction with the manager of one of the departments, I had already shared a lot of stories about this manager with him as she was the dumbest person I've ever or will ever meet:

(Number as the manager)

Number : RasT110e5 I want to know how to move text from window to window

Me ( not surprised ): OK, I don't really know what you mean, but can you show me what you are trying to do?

Number : Yes, I've seen my team do it but I don't quite understand how, because they don't use the mouse..., (proceeds to show me that she basically wanted to copy and paste text)

Me : Ohhh ok (understanding that shortcuts are not well known by everyone and that she might be a MacOs user), you need to drag the mouse over the text like so, then press Ctrl and while pressing also press 'C', the- (cuts me off)

Number : Nothing happened....

My coworker (looking at me covering his face with the monitor so only I can see him): (contains laughter)

Me : Yeah, this is just the first step, now you nee- (cuts me off)

Number : This is so hard, isn't there an easiest way???

Me : No, there is no shorter way that 2 commands, as you need to select where to paste the text you just copied.

Number (not convinced): ok...

Me : After you've done step 1 you need to go to where you want to paste the text, click on the text editor of that application and then while pressing Ctrl press 'V'

Number (surprised like the first human being to discover fire): YEAH YEAH that's what I wanted, do it again.

Me : (explain the ""process again"") and (ask her to do it a couple of times)

Number : great, thanks. (leaves our office)

My coworker was in disbelief on how someone can be this detached with technology and manage more that 10 people for a department that oversees the action of potentially any department in the company, but well, we laugh it of and continue with our day.

Not 5 mins later we get a knock on the door and, she again. It took all of my control to not laugh to death upon the first thing that came out of her mouth...

Number : What came after Ctrl???

My coworker (again covering himself against the monitor): (starts looking at me like somehow this person is stealing IQ points from everyone around her)

Me: Number come here, sit with me, we will go over the process again until its clear.

Number : How come there's not an easier way?? you IT guys always make it so hard for the normal people.

Me : \*exhale\*...

Me : (I explain the process around 5 times and write a post it note with the 2 shortcuts and in which order to use them)

After she finally leaves the office I let go and start laughing uncontrollably hard and my coworker had the biggest face of disgust that is humanly possible to do.

For me it was just another funny story of someone that just didn't get technology, but my coworker took it personal, and later on when I left the company and he replaced me in that office as the one with more experience, he took it upon himself to get rid of this manager, but that's a different story.

TL;DR: Manager didn't know that copy and paste existed since 1973 and blames us for it.

**EDIT**

There are a lot of comments of why didn't I just teach her with the right click method, I didn't because this particular company has tons of proprietary software which overrides the right click options for specific business logic options, and I didn't want to have that dreaded but completely foreseeable call ""RasT110e5 this program broke my copy paste... I need this fix now!!!""

**EDIT 2**

To whomever wants to now how Number's story in the company continued, my coworker added this [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/gqc9g1/look_into_my_eyes_you_are_fired/)."
talesfromtechsupport,"I work internal tech support (calls and chats) for a large company. I got this call tonight:

Me: Tech support this is LaterallyHitler, how can I help you?

User: I changed my password on Friday, and my account is locked.

Me: *checks account status* I see that it’s not locked.

User: But it says locked at the top!

Me: *facepalm*

Me: That’s the lock screen, it doesn’t mean your account is locked. You should be able to just login.

User: I tried that earlier and it didn’t work!

Me: *thinking it could be a credential caching issue considering the recent password change* Try your old password.

User: That didn’t work either, I’ll try my new one again.

...

User: It worked! I had just switched one of the letters with one of the numbers all along.

Me: *headdesk*"
talesfromtechsupport,"This took place in early-mid 2018. I work for a company that outsources tech support to other companies. Before my promotion I was in the department contracted out a particular ISP central division for their Wireless Gateway tier 2 Department (before it all became just tier and at the time we were taking regular calls on top of escalation calls). I get a call from a woman and this is how it goes (Note: Cx = customer):

Me: Thank you for choosing ISP, how may I help you?

Cx: My internet aint workin'.

Me: I'm very sorry to hear that, let me just pull up your acc- (cuts me off)

Cx: There's no power.

Me: ...I'm sorry? There's no power?

Cx: Yeah, in the building.

Me: (pauses for a stretch of time as my mind is trying to grasp stupidity) o-okay....  
Cx: There's now power. (said a little more loudly)

Me: ....Right. (pauses again) You need power for it to work.

At this point the caller went quiet and I could hear her muttering to someone in the background ""it needs power for it to work.""

Cx: Well there ain't no power! -she exclaimed loudly.

Me: ...right. You need power for for your internet to work.

Cx: The buildin' got no power.

At this point my headache was growing as I found myself caught in a loop. After an awkward pause I finally respond again.

Me: Right... we are an ISP. You need to call the power company for this.

I hear her again mutter to someone in the background ""we need to call the power company for this.""

Cx: But we pay you.

Me: Right. You pay us for your internet; not for power. Internet needs power to run. You will have to call your power company.

Cx: (after a brief pause) Okay.

After that the call immediately disconnected. To this day, despite all the idiocy I deal with day-in and day-out, calling and ISP for a building-wide power outage is still something I cannot wrap my head around."
talesfromtechsupport,"This happened around 2011-2012 when I worked tech support for a major telecom company.

""Hello, thank you for calling Company, this is-""

""Man you gotta help me get this phone working, man, it's life or death""

At this point I should note that he was calling in from the line on an account that I'm assuming, but not entirely sure, was his.

""Ok, let's get you fixed up. Can you verify the name on your account?""

""Man we don't have time, this an emergency!""

At this point I decide to just start with basic hardware troubleshooting since I don't have to verify anything for that. ""I understand this may be urgent, what's the issue?""

""You gotta help, man, there are bodies! Bodies, man!""

I pause for several seconds, replaying that in my head and confirming that yes, he did in fact say there are bodies.

""Sir, what's the issue with the phone?""

""Oh fuck, I gotta go."" -click-

Never did find out what was wrong with the phone."
talesfromtechsupport,"So I work in the IT Department for a school district and lately a lot of our work has been remote, but I still go in for a few hours on some days if I have a reason to. Today happened to be one of those days. I was getting in my car so I could drive to a different school and off in the distance I heard a car horn honk twice followed by an engine revving. I looked over and I see one of our maintenance trucks barreling towards me.

The truck veered into the line of empty parking spots I was parked in and was now driving directly at me. A few yards from my car, he turned and stopped on a diagonal with his driver's side facing me and just said ""Hey whenever you get a minute can you go to the maintenance barn and look at the computers? One of them completely froze up on me yesterday.""

This was a nice twist on the typical ""While you're here..."" requests, or somebody stopping me in the hallway. I can honestly say this was the first time someone has driven a vehicle at me to ask for help. I found it amusing, I hope you all did too."
talesfromtechsupport,"I get a call from one of our production crews that is at a nearby location. They are using our in house camera gear and have a bunch of the new battery packs I built.

The original packs were so poorly made I was surprised they even worked. The first time I opened one I found spliced wires that did not need splices. A 12"" wire from a relay to a battery had 3 segments of wire spliced together. Upon examination of others I revealed the same splices and weird wiring. When I spoke to the manufacturer it was learned that the people who made them just copied the prototype EXACTLY with no understanding of how anything worked.

The reason I got into this was because a couple of packs had failed and one had gone Three Mile Island.  These were 28V 4000mAH nicad batteries. If they shorted they could really make a mess and sometimes a fire. The shorts were coming from little trims or wire that had dropped into the case when the cloners were making them.

The issue they had was the batteries were not charging overnight. They would plug them all in  at the end of the day, close up the camera trailer and then go home. The next morning they would come in and the batteries would be sitting there with their charge lights on. When they started using them the ones fresh off the charge would fail in half an hour instead of the 4 to 6 hours they should run. If the got one that had been sitting still on charge in the trailer for the morning it would last longer.

Batteries were sent back to me for testing and all tested fine. I charged them overnight in my charging bay and they had a full charge the next morning.

Let me tell you about the charging bay... Because of the TMI experience I had a new rack built to charge batteries. It had a big relay that controlled the 2 20A circuits for charging batteries. That had 2 Big Buttons for **Power On** and **Kill Power Now**. There was also a smoke detector for unattended operation of the **KPN** function. If the power went out a human had to push the Power On button once power was restored, just to make sure nothing was amiss when power was applied. When there are a few thousand watt hours of batteries there you don't want any unexpected things to happen.

After a week of this back and forth I went and visited the location. I examined the charging setup in the camera trailer and found they were plugging in 12 battery packs to a single 15A line that was run to the trailer. This also ran the lights in the truck.  I looked at this and got curious how it was working at all. These packs draw about 2.5 amps each to charge.  The nerds out there will know that 12 devices drawing 2.5A is 30 amps. The thing is though the pack ramps up the charge current and it starts around an amp and takes about 30 min to get up to full steam. More than enough time to make a hasty retreat.

I then had a chat with the Teamster who managed the camera truck and trailer. When questioned he told me that when he came in in the morning he would fine the power for the trailer was out. The breaker would trip. Being the good Teamster and taking care of his camera crew he would reset the breaker so the power and lights would be on when the crew arrived. He never mentioned it to anyone.

I did some re-education of the camera team and got them into a different overnight power regimen and all was well in the world.

Teal Deer: Batteries were tripping the breaker, but it was being reset before anyone noticed what was wrong. And sometimes you have to make a house call to see for yourself."
talesfromtechsupport,"For context, I'm not a support tech but work in Robotics at my company, where we roll out digital robots to automate company operations ranging from cust. care to finance to back office operations.

I usually arrive late at work (11-11.30a) but at 10.30a my phone went off and my boss needs me in the office asap, so I go. I arrive and go to the room where my teammates are already present losing their shit dealing with tens of departments (credit ops, back office ops, care, finance, delivery, accounts, etc.). Some 70-80 of our 250+ bots are down and so hundreds of transactions are stacking up by the minute which people have to fulfill manually, although we don't have the capacity because the company has been firing ppl ever since we came in and started automating everything.

No one can figure out what's going on.... We try to remote in and the VMs are up and running. Director is already on alert, we're trying to troubleshoot, automation scripts are still there, nothing wrong with run/build time scripts. All 4 of us (useful teammates) + robot controller (someone promoted from support and handed to us) + my manager (knows nothing about our automation) are trying to troubleshoot. Soon the VP is on alert from all the pissed process owners (and their bosses). For hours we're trying to reboot machines, reconfigure and reinstall scripts, but nothing. We alert IT but they're no help and are confused and clueless too.

I was getting my 10th cup of coffee, furious and confused. Decided to call the data center (owned by the company, outside the city), described what was happening, asked them to physically locate the VMs assigned to us, and reboot those mainframes as the last resort I could think of (none of us are networking/hardware guys). A data center tech goes to the physical server and notices the internet wire disconnected from the back, they checked the surveillance cams and turns out a cleaner was cleaning the floor and mopped aggressively in the back causing the wire to disconnect. But since the computers were all on site, they still appeared on the LAN 🤦‍♂️"
talesfromtechsupport,"For context I'm not a support technician but since i work in computer science, i made some support for my familly. And English is not my native language, sorry for any mistakes.

My brother and I gave our mother a laptop computer for christmass. She is a lot reluctant to new technolgies, but we decided that she needed to learn how to use a computer. We showed her how to look at her bank accounts , how to use video replay,... So basically she only uses the web browser and do not know how internet works (internet provider, modem, wifi...)

One day she was leaving for her secondary house which do not have internet connection.

I asked her why she took the computer. She replied to me that internet will work by there. I told her no. She insisted. I asked why she thinks it will work : she told me that internet is comming in her computer through SATELLITE. I started to smile.  I tried to explain that no, it's comming trough the wifi. She told me no the computer IS receving internet with satellite. I asked why she thought that her computer was satellite ""enabled"".

And ho boy, i didn't see that coming. She opened her computer, start it and show me victoriously  the satellite logo turning on. See?

We gave her a ""toshiba satellite"" laptop model.

I could not help but laught.I  had to apologize, telling her that it was her disarming logic that took me by surprise.

PS: Here is the logo that she though was satellite reception: [Logo](https://ibb.co/z5sBNhm) It does turn on with the laptop.

PS2 : She laught whith me when she understood her mistake."
talesfromtechsupport,"I worked some years Ago for an internet provider.

I was support level 3 on the  app that callcenters used to create tickets from end users calls.

Some callcenter where in house, in the provider country, some where in foreign countries with specialised callcenters company.

One morning i got escalated by a call center telling me that my app was not working.

I checked my monitoring tools. Everything was fine.

I told Lvl2 to ask if they troubleshout basic stuff on their side. ""yes of course""

Some time later i got 3 ou 4 call centers escalating with random problems.

I started to see less activity (The numbers of ticket are whithin 10% of comparable days. Mondays with mondays, wednesdays whith wednesday,...).

Somthing should be wrong. So i started a crisis conf call and took the lead. We asked to network to check offsite proxies, firewall,... Everything between them and my servers. We found nothing. 

Users who had the problem started to be abble to work again but users not affected started to have the issue... Random problem. GREAT.

After some hours i got bored and was taking my ""personnal browsing time"" on some computers news websites while listening the call.

After few minutes i found a very interesting article : Kaspersky update disrupt internet connectivity of computers. Forced update can solve the issue.

I unmute my microphone and said : Can you asked end users if the can acess to usual website?

Call centers : google is not reachable, microsoft... Intranet is not working. 

Me (mute): WTF. Facepalm. 

Me (unmute) : SO your are making me manage a crisis call but you are not able to check if you computers can browse?  Seriously? Our app is a lightweight app. It works in the browser. So if you can't browse you can't use it.

Call centers :  dead silence...

Me: Tell me Call centers? Is your antivirus Kaspersky?  (Kaspersky was not internal antivirus).

Call centers : Yes. Why?

Me :  Check with YOUR internal IT services.  Your antivirus software updates kill browsing and your IT team is, I think, pushing the new updates to solve it. It explains the randomness or waves your are seeing.  Have you checked with your local admins ou IT before escalading us?

Call centers: Oooops.....

I issued a return of experience note saying: Lvl1 or at least Lvl2 MUST check with call centers that  basic stuff like browsing is working BEFORE escalating a critical issue on my apps.

If i did not take time for personnal browsing, i think i might still be on this call."

BACKSTORY: Every hour of the day of my job- customers ask for free or discounted parts for their fitness equipment. I've posted before- so here's another incident that happened just today (by the way I troubleshoot/sell parts to customers for out of warranty tech support for a large fitness equipment co)

Y'all it's hard to just not end up a grinch and never give anyone anything for free- or conversely hard to not give in every time someone bitches/moans... However- we have an IN-warranty and an OUT of warranty tech support team. I am OOW. If I worked on both teams- it'd be a different story. Also- I work partially off commission- so if I give everything away for free I don't make as much and so my student loans and car sits- longer to pay off.

I typically cut customers a deal: if they

A) are nice/respectful/don't insult me or the company and they don't whine

B) If really want to fix their machine RIGHT- and need to buy a few parts- since I have faith in that they're fixing it up good not just putting a bandage on it- I'll give them often wholesale cost if they get a few things... But then you have customer's asking for the bandage-part-ala-carte...and if part breaks again then they're mad so we just offer ""bandage parts'' at full cost- no budging. Since it's electronic- not fixing ROOT of issue- and I try to be fair/courteous whenever possible......but some things def won't get me to budge lol

 STORY:

Annoying lady: *Hi I'm calling because I'm \[insert long sob story about how she is 50 yrs old and hasn't even used this equipment for 10 hrs total even though it's been sitting for 10 yrs and now she's starting her ""journey"" again and our equipment we should stand behind and she already paid someone 100 dollars to come tell her that she needs a replacement part]...so yea my machine is...* 

(You read that right, she doesn't even ask me a question about anything in particular just trails off about her life..something about what someone local told her but nothing directly she's even asked)

Me: (unsure of what to say and realizing she's prolly a choosy beggar) 
*I'm sorry to hear that- well sounds like you've already narrowed it down to what you need- someone diagnosed it for you already is that right?*

Annoying lady: *well yes I' mean uh uh I'm just trying to say that I think your company should stand behind your product and I - I - I just don't know why this would break already. I've only used this 5 hrs total!! (before she said 10) - and I just I just -don't understand*

Me: (starting to get irritated at her lack of actually asking for something besides rambling outright- tryin to refocus)  
*ok- so step one is - do you have your serial #? And did the local tech tell you whether it's the LOWER or UPPER board you need? These rarely go out unless there is a power surge, or there's lack of maintenance so board draws high amperage, shorts out...of course t here are things inexplicably that can happen..what symptoms did you have if any leading up to board shorting out?*

AL: **climbs mount Everest in background- complaining about how she has to get on her hands and knees to get even the MODEL # for me..of course can't get down to ground enough to find Serial** *well I see from this guy's notes that came here I need the LOWER control board- ok - see I see here my receipt- It shows {several years ago's date)*

Me: *Ok well I am sorry to say but your parts warranty was only 1 yrs- you are several years past the warranty- it sounds like you need a part- would you like me to get you a quote?*

AL: *Well well - I - I - I just don't think I should have to pay for this!!! I have seriously only used this 5 years. Can't you P-leasaaaaase just understand me in MY shoes! This is a D-E-F-E-C-T!!!*

Me: *well I am sorry maam- I do understand- however at the end of the day- this is the place to purchase parts- that's my job. Now if you want to troubleshoot a bit more- I can tell you the part typically doesn't go out unless it's either bumped, damaged- or there's a power surge. It'd be very rare for this part to fail unless under-maintained. Now of course some things happen in life that are inexplicable- however even if it is a defect, that would have been covered in the first year- which is why that warranty is in place- typically we would have discovered defect right away. I can't guess as to how your board blew out unfortunately unless we troubleshoot more. Now would you like me to get you a quote?*

AL: *What's your name!! I - I - I thinkkk that if you will not give me part for free- then I will have to escalate this. I don't want to but I'm going to have to. Now- I think I'd like you to get me to a manager*

(my manager first of all RARELY is available- we don't have a team lead. Me and the 2 guys I work with pretty much tell people no when they ask for management- because mgmt lets us basically be our own boss- as firm as we need to be- and certainly handing out discounts is not something we ever HAVE to do- only if we WANT TO- And just as long as we're firm and polite- he doesn't care if we just enforce policy.)

Me: *I am sorry no manager is available. This is policy. Is there anything else regarding your machine you had a question about?*

AL: *Get me to a manager*


Me: *""sorry none is available, and management won't speak to you about something like this. If you need to order a part just callback here or visit ....dotcom. Have a great day""*

Disconnected call- 

This lady didn't even hear price of part and wantwd a manager. I do like that I am authorized to stand my ground and policy and my manager has trained me to act as my own manager. 
You can cry and whine all you want but reality is, businesses are not run like they used to where ""customer is always right""

By the way I have been on phones for 5 to 6 yrs. Started out doing census work for govt. To working for GE parts. To now working for a fitness company that is international. I may be a lil harsher in my delivery and less kissing up to customers as some people may be allowed to be- but I am thankful for a lil more lax work environment as nothing is worse than not being able to be firm with customers or having leeway to put them in place/re-focus topics. I am sure this call I may get a bit of a talking to but as of now since my department is facing an 800% increase in calls past 2 mos with covid- my company can't really fire me lol knock on wood

EDIT: To add ending I missed/formatting
Also this is the second post- deleted my first post as in title I wrote whine spelled like the beverage,  and couldn't live with myself"
talesfromtechsupport,"Another story from my web hosting days.  

This time I was working the evening shift and it was a quiet night.  I took the opportunity to get a few tickets out of the way and manage other tasks when I notice an alert pop up on the monitoring board.  It's showing a massive sudden increase in traffic - not DDoS level, but still concerning.  At about the same time an alert pops up for one of our shared servers:  high load, connectivity issues, other services not responding.  The amount of traffic wasn't concerning as such, it was just unusual, unexpected and sudden.

I give it a few minutes to settle down in case it's a temporary thing, but notice the traffic is increasing.  So I call the on-call tech and ask him to investigate.  He's driving home from the shops, but will be on in about five minutes to investigate it further.

Then I get a call from a customer.

Customer: ""Hi there, I hope you can help me.  My website is offline and it's a really bad time, please help!""

Me: ""No problems, let's take a look, what's your website?""

The customer gives me all the information and I take a look.  It's on the same server with the alert.

Me: ""Righto, it looks like your site is down as we're seeing a huge amount of inbound traffic and--""

Customer: ""Yeah, I think that's me.  I was contracted to work on $realityTVshow and that episode just aired tonight. They put my website on the screen just before and everyone's trying to visit my site"".

It turns out this customer was a tradie of some kind and had indeed worked on some shitty but immensely popular reality TV show.  One where people compete against each other to renovate a house or garden or some nonsense (I dunno, I don't watch the stupid things).

At this point the tech was online and had confirmed it:  there was a huge amount of traffic inbound, all trying to reach this guy's website.

Me: ""Ok, we can see what's happening.  It looks like viewers of this show are trying to load your website.  Unfortunately there's simply too many requests simultaneously and the shared server you're on can't deal with that.  That's why there's an error"".

Customer: ""Oh. So there's nothing you can do?""

Me: ""No, sorry.  We can increase the resources allocated temporarily, but that's not really going to make a difference given the amount of traffic.  Honestly, if we knew about this in advance we would've happily sorted something out for you"".

I could tell this guy was upset, but he was still remarkably calm.  He even apologised to us for causing trouble.  A quick chat to the tech and we hobbled together a shitty but workable solution: visitors would see a ""Sorry, too much traffic - try again later!"" page for his site rather than the error.  Not great, but better than nothing.

The call ended after that and I'm pretty sure I heard the guy crying.  Given the situation I was surprised we didn't cop abuse from him, and I was even more surprised when he sent feedback thanking us for doing all we could.  He understood there was little we could do, and even asked us to help him plan for this in the future.  

It was one customer I genuinely felt bad for."
talesfromtechsupport,"This is a rant . Happened just now so venting out the frustration on Reddit.

I work for Application support in a fairly large healthcare company. Our clients are hospitals which treat the most dreadful disease out there. So one of such hospitals have an application issue so we asked the customer yesterday for downtime . The primary contact for this site gave us 6 PM- 7PM today as the approved window. Having had some wisdom from working for long in IT support, I proactively asked the primary contact to  if there are any additional people\\ email distros to be notified of this downtime and asked her to include them in the communication. She did add a couple of email DL and physicists.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today 6 PM, I send out a mail notifying the start of maintenance and log in to their systems . Lo and behold , I see many users still active and working on the system. I think to myself, they must be wrapping up their work and logging off, let's give them 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, instead of users logging off, the number of users has gone up. 

I send out another mail informing that I am still seeing active users on the systems. How long I have to wait before I can start working? This mail seemed to have dropped like a stone in a puddle  because I see a hurried reply from one of the users asking two other users 'I just read the following mail. Who was working yesterday when we were notified that $ITsupport would be working on the system'. Apparently nobody else apart from the primary contact had bothered to read emails and were blissfully unaware of any activity that was scheduled today.

Mind you, the end users of this systems are senior physicists with Masters and PhDs . 

The maintenance today is cancelled and we have to get a new window now. So much for advance notification . Why don't people read their mails??"
talesfromtechsupport," Hello reddit, Long time lurker, first time poster, english is not my main language, tl:dr; in the end, and sorry for the long post, but i suck a resuming things.

I work in a small company that sells refurbished pc’s, among other services.

I got a call from a customer, that got is pc 3 weeks prior, and as called co many times with issues or questions, that have little to do with the hardware itself, but mostly with due to is configurations and choices.

Because of the, my colleague as started to give some responses, that are not so polite, but justified, and due to this, the customer requested that he does not receive support from him, again, so this time was my turn.

Me = me; hardtech = wannabe hardware technician or customer;

ME: I this is me, from abc, what can I help you with.

Hardtech: Hi, **I’m a hardware technician in a professional school…** The front audio connectors on the computer that you sold me, don’t work.

ME: Ok, can you tell me in which port you are connecting the jack, and what type headphones you are using? I’m asking th…(interrupts, but my explanation was valid, since the pc had 1 combo (headphone/mic port and a headphone port, and many people mistake them)

Hardtech: Men, **I’m a hardware technician in a professional school**, so I understand of computers, we can talk technically, and of course that I connected to the correct port.

Me: ok…, and the audio volume is correct when you connect it’ since the drivers use different volumes for both front and rear jacks?

Hardtech: Yes, the volume is ok.

Me: and if you connect to the rear jack, it works correctly?

Hardtech: yes, they work correctly.

Me: (I doubt the answers, but what can I do?) ok, since this brand as showed some issues with drivers for this OS version, have you tried accessing the brand website and download an older driver version?

Hardtech: no, where can I do that?

Me: You can go to the brand web site and search for “pro pc 6000 scc”

Hardtech: where can I search that? I can’t find the search bar…

Me: (hardware tech my a..) Then google it, it should be the first result.

Hardtech: I’m using google, chrome**, I’m a hardware technician, we can talk more technically**

Me: (internally, if you are a technician, why are you having so much trouble following simple tasks?) not google chrome, google search engine.

Hardtech: oh, ok… found it, but it doesn’t show any drivers available…

Me: IS I told you, please select an older version, to download;

Hardtech: how do I do that? **I’m a hardware technician, we can talk more technically…**

Me: (muting phone, Fuuuu…) You will se 2 links, one with OS selection and one for the version, please select OLD OS, and OLD version.

Hardtech: ok, it shows up, should I download it?

ME: (no, eat it) yes, download it please.

Hardtech: It as finished downloading, should I install it?

Me: (no, cook it with potatoes) Yes, please, and restart the machine after…

Hardtech: Ok… will this take long?

Me: should be fast, 2 or 3 minutes, btw, I need to place you on hold for a second, I need to attend the door, is it ok? (I didn’t, but I needed a break, to bash my head on the table…)

Hardtech: ok.

… after 2 minutes of deep breathing and a few hits on the table …

Me: sorry for the wait, did it install?

Hardtech: I think so, I restarted the computer on the last install panel…

ME: and is the sound working?

Hardtech: no, but you see**, I’m and hardware technician on a school, we can talk more technically.**

Me: Well, the only option is if you RMA the machine to us, so that we can look. We can have a pickup scheduled for tomorrow…

Hardtech: and that will take how long?

Me: 5 business day, minimum, 1 day for the pickup, 1 for it to be delivered to us, 1 for analyses and fix, 1 for sending, and another for it to be delivered to us.

Hardtech: that won’t do, I need it tomorrow and in 3 days again…

Me: ok, you can come o our facilities, and deliver it in hand.

Hardtech: that won’t do as well, I live on “another city”, and I don’t have a car

Me: well, can’t you use the rear audio for now, and send it after?

Hardtech: **I am a hardware technician in School,** and need the pc these days…

Me: but can you use, the rear audio?

Hardtech: No, I need the front ones working.

Me: so, how do you propose we do this?

Hardtech: Don’t know, can you come and fix it here?

ME: No, we can’t do that.

Hardtech: You think I if I reinstall OS, it may work?

ME: Sure, give it a go, and call us after

Hardtech: ok, the key is on the machine, right? I can’t find it, I only see one sticker on the side, with some numbers and letters, but no key…

Me: (screaming inside WTF!!!!) that’s it…

Hardtech: oh, I was about to rip it…

Me: please call us back, if it doesn’t work, good morning…

Hardtech: thanks.

… “2 hours latter” …

Me: Hi, this is me, from abc, how can I help you?

Hardtech: Hi, this is hardtech, **I am a hardware technician in a school, we can talk technically.**

Me: Hi hardtech, we talked this morning, did the reinstall Fix it?

Hardtech: yes, it did… but the computer is very slow

ME: Well, that may be because of updates.

Hardtech: yes, I tough so, so I powered it off, do you think that the updates will be done when I power it on?

ME:(He did not just say that…) you powered it off? The computer?

Hardtech: yes, the computer

ME: it won’t install if it is powered off…

Hardtech: oh, so I should have just powered the screen of then? Will it install if the monitor is off?

ME: (OMG, this is not happening to me, reddit here I go), yes, it will update with the screen off.

Hardtech: thanks, goodbye.

TL; DR; Customer calls for tech support, claiming to be and hardware technician on a school, but can’t do basic troubleshooting and doesn’t even know the difference between googling something and using the browser, and thinks OS updates will install with the pc turned off"
talesfromtechsupport,"First tale here under this pseudonym so I have to be a little more generic than I usually would. I work in IT as an IT Mangler over several sites in the US for a global bioscience/life science company and abroad. One of my sites has live mice in it for ascites collection (that's about as much as I know). This is a really short tale from earlier today that my wife thought was hilarious but could have brought a lesser seasoned ITM to tears; it just made me SMH and smile.          
   
Due to COVID-19 we have been able to work from home a lot, and I took advantage of that today because I have to work in the office tomorrow and Friday. The phone system at my site sends you an email when you have a voicemail but it's usually 10 to 20 minutes before it actually gets to the end user thanks to how our corporate email works (I am not at the corp site, I am in a satellite office but I report directly to the CIO).    
Around 11am today I got 3 voicemails from the ""mouse house"" - a site with over 40,000 live mice for medical tests and research, which is weird because the site manager there usually texts me or emails if there is an issue. I called them back and the head lab lady (heretofore known as NLL bc she's really nice) answered the phone.    
    

Now as an FYI, NLL is a really sweet older lady in her 60's and she has been with the company over 20 years and her job entails of lot of highly specific lab duties with the mice and the ascites so she's definitely not stupid in any way. Yesterday, the site manager had emailed me asking to reset her password (no reason why) and I did. The call....     
     
    
>Me: Hey NLL, what's up? I got 3 voicemails from your site, what's wrong?    

>NLL: I can't get into my email and nothing's working. The temporary password isn't working and it's not taking what I changed it to or the new one!   
    
>Me:  Is your Skype or Teams working so you can share your screen with me?     

>NLL: Hang on a minute. YELLS to someone else ""HEY DO WE HAVE TEENS OR SKY ON OUR COMPUTERS?""    
>NLL: She doesn't know, she thinks we have Sky.
(if you have to ask you don't have / don't use them pretty much)
    
>Me: That's OK NLL, let's try this another way (goes into AD and brings up Notepad because I planned to reset it back to her old password and that would be that until the next time). What was your old one?    


>NLL: Oh this is going to be hard.   

>Me: Just go one character at a time and I will read it back to you as we go    

>NLL: OK...It's the dash with the hyphen next to it.     

>Me: (desperately trying to figure out what what is talking about) It's the what?    

>NLL: Oh I don't know how to describe it!   

>Me: Did you say it was a dash or a hyphen? Let's try this - what key is it next to?    

>NLL: It's the SHIFT button and the number 1    

>Me: Ok that's the exclamation mark.   
   
>NLL: Oh yeah that's it!  
   
**IT WAS THE EXCLAMATION POINT, Y'ALL!!!**    
We made it painfully through the entire password (including her realizing she was literally spelling out her password in front of her coworkers so she went into another room and started whispering to me which made it harder as it is not a quiet site where she is), or so I thought, and I had typed it in notepad as we went along.    
I reset it and went about my day, telling her I had called from my cell and to text me or call me on it if she needed me again.     
    
>12:15 I get a text:       
Not working.    

I text back a picture of the notepad text of her password because I didn't think my wife could handle me calling NLL back.   

I hear nothing back so I sent her a text later and confirmed she was in, yay.     
     
My wife is still laughing and repeating ""DO WE HAVE TEENS OR SKY?""       
    
TL/DR: got a call today from a really sweet user who had no idea if she had Teams or Skype on her computer. Figured out how to help her anyway. :)    
Edit: spelling, grammar and correcting quotes"
talesfromtechsupport,"To set the stage this story happened in the 92 or 93 when I worked for a small software/hardware company specializing in dental office software. This was in the days before the modern laptop and the solution our management had found for our sales force to do onsite demos was a computer all built into the keyboard (picture a 3 inch thick metal keyboard with a VGA port). Our sales teams would ship this modern marvel of portable computing and a CRT monitor to wherever they where doing a demo then go onsite and hook it all up.

I get a call from one of the owners to hurry to their office to help one of our sales people who called with a problem. SP=sales person, Me=me

Me - What going on?

SP - I'm onsite and all setup but when I turn it on I get a message that there is no boot device.

Knowing that these wonderful portable computers had an IDE hard drive that instead of a cable connecting it to the MB sat next to the MB and the pins that normally would be connected to cable where instead just pressed into a female connector directly on the MB. And that the Hard drive wasn't mounted as firmly as it should be. I guessed that the hard drive had moved and was no longer connected to the MB fully. This usually required me to open the case and press down on the drive to seat it properly but I couldn't ask the sales person to bust out a screwdriver and open the case. So I said

Me - pick the computer up six inches off the desk and drop it.

SP- You want me to do what?

Me- Pick it up and drop it.

SP - That's what I thought I heard. I can't do that the entire staff is sitting here watching. 

Me -   If you want it to work pick it up and drop it. 

I hear a thud over the phone as they picked it up and dropped it on the desk and a minute of silence then

SP - Thank you it is working now."
talesfromtechsupport,"So part of our product offering is mobile apps that technicians can use in the field to close service calls. 

For like a solid month we had one client complain about certain users never being able to connect the app and work calls while at certain customers. We tested and did code reviews and found no issues to match what they were describing.

Finally, I had one of the techs call me when they had issues and preceded to tell me the app wouldn’t connect but that they went back to the parking lot and it worked fine. 

Ended up finding out that the customer was a hospital and the machine was in the FUCKING basement 2 stories underground. The tech didn’t believe me that data didn’t always connect when underground. So I told him to go down there again and try to load google or Facebook.

Never heard from them again."
talesfromtechsupport,"This happened on Christmas Eve 2019. My job allowed the tech support department to only work half a day. 

For clarification, I work for an ISP that has a large number of elderly customers. My company encourages the elderly customers to call for any little thing. I often make a joke that “if you stub your toe, please let (company name) know.”

Me = Me, NL = Nice Lady

On this day I got a call from a nice older lady. I don’t remember the exacting wording, but the conversation went something like this: 

Me: Thank you for calling (company) how can I help you today?

NL: Yes, I was wondering if you can send a technician to my house to help me.

Me: Since it is Christmas Eve, and the field techs will stop working at 11:00, I cannot promise that I can get a technician to your home today. What’s the issue you’re having specifically? 

NL: I’m diabetic and I need someone to check my blood sugar for me. I can’t do it because my fingers get cramped up real easy.

Me: I’m sorry ma’am that is not something our technicians are even allowed to do. Have you tried calling your doctor or the hospital?

NL: My doctor is on vacation. Can you please just send a technician? (Company name) technicians are really nice and I don’t think they would have a problem helping me.

Me: I’m sorry ma’am, I cannot send a technician for that. I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but I can only recommend you contact a medical professional, because our technicians cannot test your blood sugar.

NL: (sounds like she’s starting to cry) Okay.... I don’t know what I’m going to do now. I’m sorry I bothered you. Have a merry Christmas.

Me: I apologize that I’m unable to help you further. I hope you can find someone that can help you. If you have any technical issues, please feel free to call us back. Have a Merry Christmas. 

I felt bad for her, but there was no help I could offer her, other than recommending actual medical personnel."
talesfromtechsupport,"Few years ago,  I was working IT support for a small software company that went through a growth period, during that time they had hired a “marketing/design” person out of California. (The company was in the Midwest.)

I setup a computer for the user to use, normal FruitBook that we had on hand. The user came to the office, did the standard new hire things then a few days later, headed back to California.

The following week, I get an email from the CEO with the CTO and the users CC’ed on it.

This is unacceptable, this new user is a key part in getting the message out on our company, and these specs on the this laptop are not good enough for this user, get a new, more powerful one , setup and shipped out ASAP.

(The laptop was a $3500 FruitBook)

I was a little confused, the user has been here for a week. What could you be doing to need some crazy spec laptop? Being newish at the company, I went to the CTO to get his take.

Me: Did you read that email CEO just sent.

CTO: Yeah that laptop is more than enough to get the job done the user is tasked with.

“Then a smirk flashed on the CTO’s face.”

CTO: You know what, lets get the user a new FruitBook. I feel like shopping.

The CTO proceeds to custom build a new FruitBook with the max performance options, and adds many bells and whistles to it.

New price, a little under $10k.

CTO: There I will email CEO and get the go ahead. (Doubting that the CEO would go for it for that price.)

A little while later, CTO emails me that the laptop is in process and I need to go pick it up, in a few weeks.

Shocked, I go to talk with CTO again.

Me: Really? CEO went for that?

CTO: Yep.

Me: Well, okay then.

Once the new Fruitbook was ready, i picked it up and  set it up, and shipped it out to the user. No more complaints.

The fun of it all is that, with in 3 months the company when on the downward path. The growing company started to shrink again, as people where let go. One of the people let go was the user from California.

We got the FruitBook shipped back to us.

Me: Hey CTO the FruitBook from California is here.

CTO: Okay reset it and give it to me.

Me: “Oh!” Now I get why you had that little smirk when you ordered that laptop.

CTO: Yep, I built it like I was building it for myself, longer wait time, but it’s mine now. Would not want to let the expensive FruitBook go to waste, you know?

Luckily my time at that company was not very long, before I got out of there with ""most"" of my sanity still intact."
talesfromtechsupport,"Last week I get a text message from one of my co-workers, ""I can't connect to the Remote Desktop server, it keeps saying my connection failed."" So first things first, I have her send me a pic of the error. Sure enough, it's a connection error. I'm currently connected to the remote server she's trying to get to, so I know it's not a server problem. Next step for me is to log into TeamViewer and make sure her computer is even online. Everyone at our company knows that I use TeamViewer to remote into their PCs for tech support, and I've done so previously for this user. I also told her I was going to check TeamViewer to see if I could see her PC online. I check, and it shows her PC is offline, which confirms my suspicion that something is wrong on her end.

The next bit of conversation over texts turns my hair grayer than it already is:

Me: ""It looks like there's something wrong on your end, I don't see you online. You should call your ISP and find out if there's an outage in your area.""
Her: ""Can you connect to my laptop and check my internet connection?""

I don't think I've ever facepalmed so hard in my entire life. Thankfully, since this was over text, she didn't hear me give myself a minor concussion.

In the end, all was well. She ended up realizing that one of her WiFi routers had gotten unplugged, and after plugging it back in she was up and running again."
talesfromtechsupport,"About  10 years ago or so, I worked for a company that had some sites that  were out of the country. We had one international location that was  shutting down, which means we weren't paying for expensive network  connectivity anymore.  Don't remember if they had DSL, cable or what  after their T1s were removed but it was adequate. That is until we got  an email from the Operations Manager for that site.

He  complained that their network connectivity was extremely slow and  hindering getting work done. I passed this onto one of my guys to  initially look at it. He was able to gain access to this manager's  computer via whatever remote software we used at the time. About 5  minutes after I've passed this off, I get an IM from my guy asking me to  come over to his computer and take a look at what he's found. What do I  need to look at I wonder? How can he need my help with just 5 minutes  of troubleshooting done?

Apparently,  the Operations Manager didn't think that perhaps the P2P sharing of  media (I can't say the type so we'll just call them ""videos"") would slow the site's Internet connection significantly. This  manager had left for a bit as he knew we were on his computer and I  didn't have a cell number to reach him. I asked for the keyboard and  opened up Notepad on the Ops Manager's computer.  My note was something  like ""Are you f'ing kidding me? We are doing no further troubleshooting  while you are illegally sharing ""videos"".  Give me a call. -Sparky""

No  further action was taken on my end because the damn location was  getting shut down. What would be the point? No call was made to me from  the Ops Manager but I did get a very apologetic email that was vague on  details but acknowledged he pulled a bonehead move.

TLDR; User complains about slow internet at a site.  Turns out he's slowing it down because of the P2P ""videos"" he's sharing."
talesfromtechsupport,"I am still weak at the knees while writing this. Please forgive any spelling and grammar errors.


History: 3.5 years ago I started working for Company. They own multiple private schools around the world. I was given 2 schools to support. My 1st day at Site1 was a horrifying learning experience. 2003 DC and a Media drive that was litteraly an external HD plugged into a managers computer. Over the years I have sent emails explaining, with links, just how truly awful these 2 things are. Supporting the Server and Media have been a bane.


Over the last 2 years, Company have been running a country wide hardware upgrade. All Staff and Students got upgraded computers, tablets and laptops. Bet you can guess what didn't get upgraded?


Over the weekend Head Office finally moved all the staff files online. (Yes, our 2003 DC was also the File Server) Today I had the glorious task of decommissioning the Media ""server"" from the system.   


I went upstairs and entered the office. Caressing the Drive, I methodically followed the cable back to it's slot in the PC. Carefully I slowly slide the USB cable out of the computer. A shudder passed through me as I felt the HD's spin themselves down under my palm. Reverently, I picked up the Drive and gently wiped the dust from it's cover. Then I shook the shit out of the bastard!


It felt good."
talesfromtechsupport,"We had a very annoying bug in the new FTTH software we were giving our customers. For those who don’t know or don’t remember, I’m a tier 2 agent for an ISP. The bug was causing customer’s phones to auto hang up when they were on it for long periods of time, usually after about a couple hours. Personally, I don’t talk on my phone besides at work for longer than five minutes but that’s besides the point. This bug has since been fixed about a few weeks ago, and this issue happened about a month ago.

We had told our tier 1 agents multiple times that this was a known issue and we were to receive zero tickets about it because our boss would get us to call these tickets if we’d get any, and it would simply waste our time. We’d still get tickets from lazy T1 agents or T1 agents that didn’t want to explain to customers that it was a known issue. 

There was a T1 agent who sent a ticket for a customer who I will refer to as Loon or L for short. This is how that call back went.

> Me: Hi, this is Me. Is this Loon? I’m calling back about the ticket regarding *Bug.* 

> L: Oh, yes. Did you fix it?

> Me: Actually, I’m calling to let you know that this is a known issue, and we’re working on a fix. There are multiple customers affected by this. Please be patient, we do understand how frustrating it can be. 

> L: So, you’re just hacking into our software and telling us it’s a known issue? 

> Me: *confused* I’m sorry? 

> L: I’ve been around on this planet long enough to know when you people are hacking into my phone line. I’ve already had to unplug everything in my **house** to stop you people from spying on me. I like making long phone calls, I don’t need or want you people spying on me. I should report this to the police.

> Me: L, we are not tapping or hacking into your phone line. There is a well known issue at the moment and I’m just calling to let you know that it will be fixed with time. 

> L: That’s bull! *click* (They swore)

I did not even bother to try calling him back. I closed the trouble ticket with: 

*Advised customer about known bug. Customer stated it was bull and that we were hacking his phone. Closing ticket.*

Some people make me question the human race."
talesfromtechsupport,"Posted this as a reply on another thread but thought it deserved an expansion on the story.

Back in the late '80s I worked for a Point of Sale company. We served mostly the restaurant/hotel industry.

One of our lines was a fully programmable register with preset function keys.

Basically they were programmed with pictures of the food on the keyboard so you could use sub-minimum wage labor to run them.

One of our customers was a sub shop. and I don't know where they got their employees but these were not the best and brightest. 

Now a quirk of these machines was the printer. You could use it to validate checks. You put the check in the printer and it would print the transaction number on it. 

Now paying by check in restaurants is fairly uncommon but it did happen back then. And at this site this is how it usually went...

Ring up the transaction.

Enter the amount tendered.

Press the ""Check"" transaction key.

The display would then say ""Insert Check and press any key to continue...""

Idiot clerk would then say ""I don't see the any key...""

I can swear as gospel that this happened because I heard it with my own ears as I was training them on the machine.

Now I could have changed the prompt to say ""Press the Check (or any other) key to continue"" but me being a smartass instead added a new key to the keyboard and labelled it ""ANY"". 

Problem solved."
talesfromtechsupport,"Great sub here girls and boys, (just shorted out recently) and getting plenty of laughs scrolling thru. Which reminded me of a frustrating situation I had some years ago with a client of ours whilst offering support on their Point of Sale terminal. 

I took a call from a client who said they were having trouble getting their computer to work.  
 So after the standard 2 \~ 3 minutes of what she was referring to when saying “The computer wasn’t working”  I realised that it was in fact the software that wasn’t responding. So I asked her to press the Escape key to clear the error. Anyway she couldn’t find the escape key, so I told her it’s the button on the top left-hand corner of the keyboard. She still couldn’t find it….  
 Me, thinking ok, POS terminal, it may be elsewhere.  
 So I got her to read some of the buttons/locations on the keyboard back to me F4 F3 F2 F1.  
 ME - yep, yep, yep good ok. (You guessed it, still no escape key...& you can’t stop them talking when their on a roll) anyway after an awkward/frustrating several minutes of her announcing just about every letter in the alphabet & describing nearly every other button on the keyboard, she advises me that she indeed has a button in the top left hand corner with **ESC** written on it…Could that be it ????  
 

ME: Ohh, I’am not too sure. ( I was exhausted by this time) can you try pressing that one for me instead then.

 Her:  ”Click” YES, I fixed it!!  
 Me: Great, Thanks for your help. By now."
talesfromtechsupport,"I have a story to share. I work in a chat based call center and this pandemic has caused customers to be crazier than usual. This one guy chatted in with about an issue with his product that ended up being hardware related. I gave him his service options which were to either bring it to the store or mail it into our service center. 

He instead demanded that we ship him a new one instead of him bringing it to the store or mailing it in because he had been with X company for a long time. When I told him this wasn't something we offer he demanded to speak to a supervisor. At the time we were of course having system issues as well so I couldn't transfer the chat to one of our chat senior advisors so I let him know that hey, we are experiencing some issues at this time with contacting our senior team. You are more than welcome to call X number to speak with them or you can chat back in in a couple hours and we will get you right over to them. 

He of course didn't like that and said no he was going to wait on this chat until I get him a supervisor. He didn't care how long it took he wanted to speak to one and I was going to get him to them."
talesfromtechsupport,"Working at a cellular retailer in a small town (>2000pop) was definitely an experience like no other.  But some of the tech support happenings stand out to this day.

Mr Customer came in a few minutes before closing hoping for a quick fix getting his work email functioning on his work phone.  It looked like he'd made an attempt at setting it up, but there was some key information missing.  Serendipitously enough I had interviewed for a potential job with his IT department not too long before, so I knew names and had contact info for their office.  I called and got the necessary information, and had a nice chat while entering it on his device.

The whole time Customer was in our shop he complained bitterly about how technology was needlessly complicating our lives, how techies all think they're superior, you know, the usual technophobe stuff.  It was the end of a long day, there were no other customers in the shop, and I was getting irritated with his tirade.  I definitely slipped into jerk-face mode and started worming my way into his mind via his growing emotional state.

It didn't take much.  I started by asking about learning and changes in technology, and any time I picked up on some body language or eye movement, I'd take the conversation in that direction.  Within minutes he was quite literally jumping up and down and yelling ""NO NO NO I DON'T WANT TO LEARN I DON'T WANT TO LEARN NO NO NO!..."" like a small child.  At this point I kinda snapped out of the mental place I'd gone to and realized what I'd done to this poor luddite who just wanted to read emails on his phone.

I finished with his phone, handed it back to him, and he was on his way (presumably to find a stiff drink).  I got some terrified looks from my coworker while we locked up, which I shrugged off, and the day ended.  But the sight of a full-grown man bouncing up and down and yelling has stuck with me since.

TL;DR
People's minds are fragile and sometimes it's better to just fix the thing and move on without creating any drama."
talesfromtechsupport,"A few days ago, a customer with TV service from our company called. He was really frustrated because the TV was showing a “no card detected” error. 

Customer: “I’m fucking tired of you! I know what you are going to tell me - restart the device, shift the cable, all of it and you know what? Fuck you too, I’ll make a contract with [another company].”

*Now I’m guessing he did all the procedures - checked his dish (using satellite TV), cleaned it, restarted, “all of it.”*

Me: “Alright, see the card on the left? It has to be with the chip towards the ground and the arrow pointing at the box.”

Him: “I’ll file a report if nothing happens, give me your names!” 

Me: ... *Saying my first and last names and waiting to locate the smart card*

Him: “Oh... yeah. It’s working.”

Me: “Yep.”

Him: “Listen, I’m sorry I yelled at you. You know how it is with the covid now, we can’t live without the TV. *Laughter.* Thanks for the help young man.” 

I said it’s alright, told him where the instructions for the TV box are and wished him a nice day. The next morning I received a 5/5 star rate from that customer."
talesfromtechsupport,"*This story happened just this week, I received a ticket from a hair salon that read something like ""the box-like device plugged in to the computer doesn't work"". Curious, I call them up. The following exchange ensues.*

>them: Yes, sure, but keep in mind I'm not very good at computers first

>me: that's all right, I'm good enough at computers for the both of us

...

>me: you mean a printer?

>them: yes, I wasn't sure what the right word that, I didn't want to say the wrong word.

talesfromtechsupport,"lUser: ya, say I recorded a patient last week and they come in again, like.. it won’t let me add their ID again. Can you make it so I can add it in?

Me: *quite incredulously* why do you need to add their ID again?

lUser: well because they’re coming in for, like, a follow up.

Me: *pause to try and comprehend*... so you search for the patient...? Sorry, not sure I’m following...

lUser: ya, but, like.. what if it was, like, two months ago, yoo know? Like, here *mouses over a patient in the list* like, she came in last month and then yesterday I had to put her in with the wrong, like, ID cuz it wouldn’t let me put in the right one. So can you fix it?

Me: *faith-in-humanity levels going critical* just to clarify, every time you see a patient you add in a new patient record? ....even if it’s a patient you’ve seen before?

lUser: well, ya, cuz, like, I don’t have time to be searching through all those dates, like...

Me: ma’am, there should only be one record in the database for any one patient, and that patient’s ID — as in unique identifier — should not—rather, CAN not be duplicated. The software won’t allow it because that would defeat the purpose of UNIQUE. Now if you look here *opens the search options drop-down* you can search by patient ID. Or last name if you prefer. 

lUser: ...... ya, but, like.... iunno, I’ll figure something out... *continues on with another completely stupid issue...*

UPDATE: admittedly, the seriousness of the consequences of this stories user’s actions had not fully donned on me until you guys brought it up. Being a techie, I was thinking how much of a pain it was going to be when they realized they had a bunch of duplicate records and wanted us in support to fix it for them, not specifically what it meant for their patients. I’ll be introspecting on that for a while. 

I did bring it up with my supervisor, and she’s reviewing our business associate’s agreement. 

I would like to add that the software I support is dedicated to X-ray imaging only. It doesn’t track things like allergies, previous diagnosis, medications prescribed... our customers use other softwares for that, and one can only hope this user isn’t so ignorant with whichever patient management software they use. But it is still a very serious violation of HIPAA concerns, as xrays are integral for diagnosis."

Aw  gawwd, you just made me pstd to a couple of days back. I am an IT guy,  and most of my users are moderately competent at using the equipment I  so kindly provide and maintain for them.

But  this user, lets call her Steph, well, she is a black hole because she  very dense and not super bright.  Because of the minor discomfort of a  global pandemic she is working from home. Because we are an  international company with a complex and super secret box of network  resources, Steph needed access to our vpn. And usually its simple,  people can mostly figure it out on their own. Not Steph, I knew I was  gonna need to do it for her and explain how do it again for future  reference. Turns out I overestimated her.

""Ok, first, open up zoom and send me a message, so I can remote into your computer""  
She says ok.

Fifteen minutes pass.

""Steph, Im waiting for you""

""I Cant find it""

""Steph, I left it on your desktop""

""I cant finde it""

I  was slightly angry cause it was 10 pm and I wake up at 6, and I have  been running non stop 10 hour turns with not a single day off for three  weeks.

Turns out she somehow Managed to delete zoom, on a user account with no admin privileges."
talesfromtechsupport,"So I had a very interesting conversation the other day that in the moment kinda sounded reasonable, but the more I thought about it, the less sense it made.

Subject: Monitoring software that a group of users decided they needed, did not include us in the aquisistion of, did not provide us any information about, and periodically raise a fuss to us when it doesn't work, often leaving us to work with the vendor who periodically comes on-site to configure/update/etc... while we are remote tech support.

**Kapn**: Me, the hero of our story

**Manager**: My boss, kinda new, still learning the ropes

**Vendor Rep:** Tech support for the Vendor of the software in question.

**Manager**: KapnBanjo, I need you to call Vendor, there's a problem with the monitoring software at one of our sites, and they are saying it's a problem with our envirenment being incompatible with the software.

**Kapn**:  Uh, sure, but isn't it working elsewhere? How can it be incompatible if it's working?

**Manager**: Well, they think it's because of Group Policy

**Kapn**: That doesn't make any sense, the people it's working for are in the same policy

**Manager**: Thats a good point to raise, with them.

**Kapn**: I got the hint, calling the Vendor.

\---

**Vendor Rep**: You have everything locked down, so I can't fix the problem with these new users.

**Kapn**: Is it still working for the old users?

**Vendor Rep:** Yeah, you must have them in a different, hold on... ""Org-an-i-zation Unit"" is what I think it's called

**Kapn**: They are all in the same OU

**Vendor Rep:** Oh, well everything is locked down so I don't think I can make any changes so this will work

**Kapn**: So we don't have that much locked out, and what we do is locked out for everyone, so the old users would have the same problem. Do you know what was changed when the old users were setup?

**Vendor Rep:** No, I wasn't the rep that did that.

**Kapn**: Usually most vendors I work with have a knowledge base or somewhere they can go that will tell them what settings and what the application needs to work.

**Vendor Rep:** We just released this new version of the software 2 months ago, so we really don't know what it needs, or what the requirements are.

**Kapn**: You don't have like a knowledge base for the products you support?

**Vendor Rep:** We do, but it's all for older versions, and I've been unable to find anything that tells me what it needs to run. I don't know how we find that out.

**Kapn**: Well we have users it works for, and users it doesn't, I guess we'll need to figure out which settings are different between the people it works for and those it doesn't work for.

**Vendor Rep:** Will I need to do that, or can you?

**Kapn**: I mean, when are you next on site?

**Vendor Rep:** Tomorrow morning

**Kapn**: And it's end of day today, so I think it would make sense for you to do it while you're there, what do you have scheduled for your visit tomorrow?

**Vendor Rep:** fixing this issue.

**Kapn**: Ok, then yeah, I think it makes sense for you to try to find out what your software's requirements are and let us know.

**Vendor Rep:** Can I call you if I need help?

**Kapn**: ...Sure, why not."

I am a trained firearms instructor for the Marine Corps, at least when it came to range activities. Taught the classes where Marines all sit/prone/Stand 'shooting' at the barrel with the targets, basic CQB shooting, Pistols, and would coach on range days. Was the best 6 months of my USMC life. Took some firearm classes from a NRA/SWAT guy too for personal/Civilian carry, worked Nuke Security too for a few years. Very comfortable around all firearms, to say the least

Anyway, we're troubleshooting an XyzXyz PBX phone system in a property we own that was installed in the mid 90s, and have to call in a company who knows how to actually troubleshoot the parts. I can do some work on them, but its mostly command line/moving lines that Im familiar with. These PBX parts generally have to be removed, sent in to be refurbished as new parts just aren't available. This company also did the original install in 199#, and the contact I normally speak with about the system has retired to a warmer state. So, new tech ""Bob"" comes in. He also assisted in the phone system setup in 199#, but Ive never met/spoke with him previously. So, Bob and I get to chatting when he comes in, gets around to firearms as I see he has a sidearm when he took off his coat. Odd he's packing open carry, but hey You Do You. I never carry on the job, but do carry conceal on my off time. I mention I was a vet and ask a few questions about the gun, and get a text from the boss asking how things are going after Bob's been there about 30 minute. Look down to answer, and when I look up from my cell, the dude had pulled out his sidearm, removes the mag and just hands it to me muzzle first with the muzzle pointed downward.

I in no way asked to be handed a weapon. I dont know the dude at all beyond the 10 minutes we've been chatting during the 30 or so minutes he's been around. He didnt clear the chamber or show me that it was empty nor confirmed that the mag well was empty. Muscle memory took over, and I immediately remove the weapon from his possession and check that the mag is removed and rack the slide to lock it back. And, of course in doing so, out flies a round from the chamber.

Now, it was a dummy round BUT HE STILL HANDED ME A WEAPON WITH A ROUND IN THE CHAMBER AND WITHOUT HIM VERIFYING WITH ME THE MAG WELL WAS CLEAR NOR THAT THERE WAS A FUCKING DUMMY ROUND CHAMBERED IN THERE TOO.

At this point Im slightly stunned. After clearing it, examine it and quickly hand it back in a safe manner. He picks up the dummy round, puts it on top of the mag and chambers it back in the weapon, and pulls the trigger on the dummy round. I was about to leave to call my supervisor...

AND THEN HE HANDS ME HIS CONCEAL CARRY BACKUP THE EXACT SAME WAY.

Legit, I was too stunned at the dude to speak immediately. Im not afraid of the weapons, but Bob came into our building with loaded weapons and was just handing them to me in a potentially unsafe manner, without my asking to handle them in the first place. I hand them back, having locked back the slides and showing empty chambers and clear mag well before doing so. Bob doesn't even put them back into his holsters, and leaves them sitting on his coat behind him. Wait 5 minutes, say I gotta go piss and call my supervisor. 10 minutes later there's a cop escorting the dude out, with clear instructions that he's no longer welcome. Bob probably wasn't a direct threat, but his careless handling certainly was.

The issue was power related on the digital card carrier, and needed sent out and refurbished. But hey, phone system was fixed! Took a few weeks longer, as we had a nice conversation with the vendor about the behavior of their tech. Of all the things I expected to be handed while working in IT, this was not one of them!"

talesfromtechsupport,"another story which I also want to share

so I was helping out by going on-site with a firewall issue and I do inform the Customer that extra token will be deducted as their support entitlement is 8 x 5 (meaning we cannot support them after office hours)

in the end we spend the night until 2am to troubleshoot and we have confirm that it is hardware issue. the best part is the customer did not buy an hardware loaner support therefore we are unable to provide him 1.

so the next morning he call our Sale Manager talking this and that. out of good will we try to help him and setup a hardware loaner support at his office however there are other issue which the firewall traffic did not work as per what it was. we believe AWS could be issue. he insist us to solve the issue on the spot however we did not do so and left the his office at 3am. (we need time to look into the logs and see what is wrong)

fast forward on the 3rd day the Customer called Sale Manager why so much token was deducted even we did not solve the problem. in my heart I am like what! the best part is he even call the Vendor and say that our company did not do anything to help him. this really drive the sale manager mad over this as the vendor call and scold my sale manager saying that we are nt helpful

so the Sale Manager decide to charge him on the rental of the hardware loaner at xxK per week  and also saying their his replacement firewall software is EOS so need to upgrade and charge him as professional service at xxK

after the Customer Boss see the bills send by my company. I think she could have fainted or really want to kill the Customer for being too extreme to us(the total bill is 5 digit in USD without adding the cost of the token deducted) she send an email to us and say ""thank you for your hard work and support etc etc""

currently the Customer has tone down alot and don't dare to be so demanding. it was an eye opener for me that how harsh things can be when you really offended somebody"
talesfromtechsupport,"so I was assign this case when my customer tell me that their Server Loading Balancing is not working

I just look at the logs and see what could went wrong and I was working with the vendor to see what cause by the root cause.

I call the customer the next day

Me: ""hello this is xxx from xxx can we confirm that you have never done any changes to the load balance?""

customer: ""no no! I never do anything and the load balance fail by itself""

Me: "" alright we will back to you again""

feel puzzled on this because there is no way the load balance will fail by itself and stop assigning traffic to the server. so I decide to work with the vendor and look at the admins log file(hoping that we can find some clue)

turn out one of the customer colleague did a change by disabling the Server loading balancing option(I never find out why) due to this that why they unable to access to the server.

so I just send the screenshot of the log file and explain to customer and case closed.

it would be better if my customer want to find out if others have done any changes instead of keeping say that the load balance failed by itself"

talesfromtechsupport,"You all enjoyed my [Karen story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ggbnfb/delete_my_account_now/) from a few days ago, so I thought I'd bring you another one from my time in the web hosting game.

A number of years into the job I'd been promoted a few times and now was part of the senior support/admin team.  I rarely spoke to the lower end customers (unless it was an incident escalated up to our team) and usually only dealt with Dedicated/VPS or Enterprise customers.  The ones that paid a lot of money for services and generally knew what they were talking about.

One day I pick up a ticket from one customer who had a managed VPS with us.  This VPS supported a somewhat popular online store. I didn't recognise the name of the person who submitted the ticket, but I guessed it must have been a new tech on their end.  The ticket itself was simple:  please let us know the full specs of our VPS, any add-ons and a breakdown in cost.  I replied to the ticket with all the requested info and went on with my day.

Later in the week I get an IM from one of the phone reps.  There's a customer on the phone who wants to talk to me, in relation to the aforementioned ticket.  I found it odd he'd called the general support number, as our VPS customers had a direct phone number to us.  The call was transferred to me.

Me:  ""Good afternoon, this is goatwomble, how can I help?""

Customer: ""Yeah, hi. I've just bought this business and have been doing an audit.  I've found that you're overcharging us, and we could be getting the same thing for a 10th of the price.""

Me: ""Ok, I remember sending you the specs and pricing, if I recall you're actually on a legacy deal, so you're paying a little less than most other customers, plus you have some free stuff included that you'd otherwise be paying for.""

Customer: ""That's crap, I'm looking at your web page right now.  I can get better specs for $15 a month, yet you're charging me $280 a month!  I want you to move me to that deal today"".

It was here I realised he'd been looking at the shared hosting packages, comparing those specs to that of his VPS. He also may not have understood the difference between shared and VPS.  

Me: ""Well, you've got a VPS with us, because you need that to support your online store.  It's highly unlikely it's going to run properly on a shared server.  In fact, I'm sure you've got a fair amount of customisation that we can't do on the shared platform.""

Customer: ""Again, that's crap.  I'm looking at the specs here, and they're better than what I've got now. So if it runs on what I have now, it'll run on this.  Move me to the $15 package.""

This went back and forth a few times, and he was adamant about moving to shared hosting.  I managed to convince him that it would take a few days to organise, which he accepted.  I then walked over to my boss.

Me: ""Hey, bossman.  \*explains situation\*""

Bossman: ""Ok, we'll do what he wants.  However I'll take the ticket and get him to understand what he's doing, the risks and how it's not our problem if it shits the bed.  Then you can migrate him over to shared.""

So Bossman pens a lengthy ticket reply, to which Customer writes back with ""yeah, whatever, do it"".

The next day I do a straight migration over to a shared server, do the other needfuls and switch his DNS over.  I also shut down his VPS.

I check his site and - as expected - it's not loading.  It'd taken maybe three minutes to hit max resources.  It took him another two minutes to get on the phone to us.  Again, he'd called the general support number.  And because he now only had shared hosting and was no longer entitled to priority support, the phone rep refused to transfer him over to us.

All up, his store was offline for about three days.  In that time he'd managed to get through to some senior managers, who told us to turn on the VPS and switch over to that in the interim until they worked it all out.  The customer was screaming for compensation and threatened to get lawyers involved, however once management listened to the calls and read the ticket history, they told him there was no chance of that happening and he could fuck right off.

A couple months after this he cancelled the VPS service with us, telling us he was moving to a more reliable company.  I hope it worked out for him."
talesfromtechsupport,"So I'm basically just going to copy and past a email here that I got from a manager.

 ""I dropped off the techs’ broken laptop yesterday and I really need to know if he gave you the correct information about what happened to this computer.  I feel as though I need to in case he didn’t as this would be a large issue with me, if I had to deal with this and I didn’t know.

All field technicians are struggling to find bathrooms at this point in time, This field tech, like many others , opened his passenger door to block anyone viewing him and as he was urinating, his laptop slid off the seat and into the stream.  He did stop immediately, but obviously this is the reason it stopped working.

To sum it up, he accidentally urinated on his laptop. 

I told him to put in the report, exactly what happened but I wanted to make sure you knew.

Not a laughing matter for that kind of surprise.

He is quite embarrassed, and feels horrible about it, but I am glad he told me the truth and didn’t try and lie.  Someone would have found out later on.

I apologize for this, and thank you."""
talesfromtechsupport,"This happened at an IT support job I had a couple of years ago. The only context needed is that our clients required specific ID-cards issues to them, to log into various system. This is my first post, and English is not my native language, so please be kind!  

The call started in the most amazing way possible. I answered the phone, and was immediately greeted by a man who sounded very nervous, and a woman screaming hysterically in the background that she was ""having a psychosis"". The man explained that his wife had called us 8 times this morning (we had received a total of 5 calls this morning, all from different users) and that she had waited 30 minutes in queue to even get to speak to us (our support line did not have a queue). I asked him to explain what the problem is.

man: my wife can't access critical systems that she needs.

me: what are these systems? Is she getting any error messages?

man: \*to woman\* what are the sys-

woman: THEY'RE NOT WORKING!

man: They're not working!

me: Could you explain what is happening when she is trying to access the systems? Could I speak to her directly?

man: She doesn't want to talk to you

woman: I REFUSE TO TALK TO THEM AGAIN

The call basically went on like this. I was trying to ask questions to get information to solve their problem, but they kept throwing accusations or other unrelated pieces of information, and we were unfortunately not allowed to hang up on clients, and after a while it came to this:

me: is there a problem with her internet access? is her login card not working? 

woman: THEY ARE BREAKING THE LAW

man: she says you are breaking the law!

woman: THEIR SYSTEMS NEED TO BE AVAILABLE

me: I'm sorry. This call has gone on for 15 minutes now and you still haven't told me what system you're trying to acc-

man: The systems need to be available

me:  Yes, but there are no servers or services reported down in our system. I need to at least know what system she's trying to access if I'm going to escalate this. But before I can do that I need to be sure that it's not just a client-side issue.

man: \*to woman\* He says he needs to know what systems are you trying to access, can you show m-

woman: TELL THEM! 

man: You should know that she has friends in \*insert generic management group\*, and if this isn't solved now they will get involved.

woman: THEY WILL FIRE THE \*\*\*\* OUT OF HIM

\*I was quiet for a few seconds because I did not expect this, although the thought of being fired from the job seemed kinda nice at this point!\*

me: I'm sorry, I don't know who they are. But could you please tell me what the issue is when she's trying to access the systems.

Instead of answering the question, the man asked for the number of my boss. Which I provided. He then proceeded to threaten to call that number that I had just given him, unless I solved the issue, and fast! 

me: alright. Just try to access the system now and tell me what happens.

man: he says to try and log in now

\*a few seconds pass\*

woman: ITS NOT WORKING

\*loud bangs\*

Now im not sure if all these years in customer support has destroyed my brain, or if this genuinely makes sense, but as soon as I heard that noise, I realized she was slamming her login card on the keyboard.

me: what card reader is she using?

man: card reader?

\*loud bangs continue\*

woman: WHY CANT IT JUST \*\*\*\*\*\*\* WORK

me: if her computer does not have a slot for cards, she needs to plug a card reader into the computer.

him: That sounds overkill. why?

me: so it can read the card and log her into the system

him: then why don't we need a card reader everywhere?

me: you only need them for some of our systems

him: no, like in general. This is bullshit. We don't even own a card reader.

\*caller hangs up\*

They called again later, and my colleague was the lucky guy this time. It turned out she wasn't even using the login card that the company had issued for her. She was slamming her drivers license against a laptop keyboard and expecting that to authenticate her to the systems she was trying to access.

Most of our clients were better than this. But there were a few calls that, when I write them out, they just look completely unbelievable. Even so, I have found that being a tech support guy is often like being a free therapist that you're allowed to shout at. Even so I did generally like the job for the remaining time I had it, and eventually switched to work with back end msp."
talesfromtechsupport,"I have been with my employer for quite a long time now, and have been in many positions within the company. At one point, maybe 2005 or 2006, I was the technical manager, who managed our programmers and technical support staff. As a small software company in the technology sector, we like to stay current and usually implement and adopt things early. VOIP was one of the things that really revolutionized the business world back then, and we rolled out a fancy new system with all the bells and whistles.

This also coincided with the meteoric rise in popularity of the show South Park, and amongst the dorks in our office, it was a popular topic of conversation. In the show, a character named Timmy has very little dialogue other than screaming his name; TIMMAH!! One of the programmers, who’s name is Tim, earned the affectionate nickname TIMMAH, which everyone said in the Timmy voice, every time Tim entered the room.

An episode eventually released with Timmy singing a song, which included just a bunch of the word TIMMAH, over and over again, to a tune. Naturally, a panel of local nerds convened and concluded we had to immediately make this Tim’s ringtone on our new VOIP system. It took a little work to sample and convert the audio to the correct format and upload it to the phone system… but to a bunch of bored techs at the office, it was pretty fun.

The outcome was nothing short of epic. When an incoming call came to Tim’s phone, Timmy sprung to life and serenaded the office with a melodious round of TIMMAHs. We even changed the message tone to say GOBBLES, one of the only other words spoken by the character.

Over time, Tim’s coworkers tired of the tone, so he eventually changed it, and that’s where the story should have ended… 

&#x200B;

… Until months later, when I pick up a call from someone who was being routed from our call queue. As I picked up the line, he was laughing, and he complimented us on our interesting choices in hold music. Confused, I asked for clarification… he said after the first classical tune stopped playing, but before the next symphony, he heard at least a minute of incoherent words that sounded like TIMMAH over music.

Apparently, the phone system used our custom ring tone as hold music. I will always wonder how many customers had to listen to the TIMMAH song while waiting for help, on hold with us."
talesfromtechsupport,"Before we implemented the outright blocking of external storage devices (could be its own TFTS story due to even more Security Team terribleness), we highly discouraged users from using those things at all. We asked users to contact IT when then needed something loaded onto external storage or checked and copied off and onto the network or a user’s PC. This happened regularly, as a lot of our clients send and receive data on CDs or flash drives. These tasks have always been the responsibility of our Security Team. 

Today my group got a couple of tickets for the same thing: a request to burn files to a CD to send to a client. I immediately got annoyed at the Helpdesk, thinking they mis-assigned tickets yet again. When I looked at the tickets though, I see that one of the Security Techs assigned the ticket to my group with the following note:

>SecurityTech: Security does not have the ability to do this with no one from Security in the office. 

Really? I took a screenshot of the note and sent it to my manager in a chat message.

>Me: See above. This makes it Desktop Support’s problem because????

>Desktop Manager: What’s the ticket number?

>Me: There’s two. #51534 and #51726. 

>Desktop Manager: It’s now been assigned back to them. “Being in an office or not does not change the responsibility of a group.”"
talesfromtechsupport,"First full-on story, not sure if this belongs here, mods feel free to remove if not. No names for obvious privacy, but not needed here.

TL;DR got paid by showing my aunt how to plug the USB Type-B the right side up.

So, we all know there's always that one guy in the entire family that basically serves as tech support, right? I'm **that** guy. I get called by my aunt to help her deal with her kids being absent and needing to post explanations (not sure if it's a correct term) about their absence to school.

*'No problem'*, I'm thinking to myself, *'We'll just print out a few pages to write them explanations'*. Now, keep in mind that about a couple months ago, I installed Lubuntu into that PC (somewhat relevant). So I was optimistic that the drivers should get picked up right away.

Nope. Even though it's powered and plugged in, printer ain't being detected. ***\`lsusb\`*** confirms my suspicion. I spend about an hour trying to get the drivers going, cause I figured it might be drivers. Nope. I get my laptop and a spare cable I had in my backpack and peek over to the back of the printer.

The Type-B USB cable seemed fine on the outside. I pull it out. Cable itself has no obvious damage. so I plug it back in. Goes in a little stiff but it gets in there. Still nothing. Now I think it's the cable, so I grab the spare I had.

As a habit, I check the port and the cable to make sure they align. Upon plugging it in, the printer starts chugging right away. That's when it hits me.

The original cable had been plugged in **UPSIDE DOWN.**

I help the aunt fill out the absence explanations, scan them in and send them out. She hands me payment and I drive away, wondering to myself how can you fit the USB cable upside down.

EDIT: ok grammar police"
talesfromtechsupport,"This one happened earlier today and further dumbfounded me as to how bold some users can be with equipment that is not their's...

I picked up a ticket for a user that was having a problem getting his password to sync between the domain and his laptop. He, like the majority of our user base now (and probably most of the world), has been working from home and he was prompted to change his password recently. He did so yesterday or the day before, but submitted the ticket when his laptop would repeatedly not take the new password he's changed it to. The corporate VPN would accept the new password, but no matter what he did, the laptop was stuck on the old password. At this point, I got the ticket from tier 1 with full understanding of the situation so I had to call the user to have him come in to the office to try and sync the passwords while being directly connected to the network (I'm still working in the office because I can't exactly work from home and handle hardware issues).

Cast of characters is self-explanatory so I won't bother with descriptions. Script is paraphrased:

**$Me:** ""Good morning, $user. I understand you're having an issue with getting your recently changed password to sync over to your laptop...""

**$User**: ""Yes, let me fill you in on what's happened..."" (proceeds to tell me everything that's already been outlined in the ticket)

**$Me:** ""OK, so at this point, you'll have to come in to the office and we'll see if that can get your system synced to the domain.""

**$User**: ""Sure, I can be there within the next half hour or so. While I'm there, could you look at another issue I've been having as well? My system's been bluescreening a couple times a week and it's a bit frustrating.""

**$Me**: ""Yeah, that won't be a problem.""

**$User:** ""Will I need to wait outside in my car while you're looking that over? How long will it take?""

**$Me:** ""Well, I'll actually need you here so that you can enter your password on your laptop to sign in, so you'll need to come in the building. As for how long it'll take, that honestly depends on what could be causing it. It could be as simple as updating a driver or it could end up being as bad as needing to reimage the system. I won't have a better answer until I have a better idea of what's going on.""

**$User:** ""Okay, no problem. So should I take out the second SSD that I have in my system? Do you think that could be causing the bluescreens?""

**$Me:** (after a rather lengthy pause) ""You...you installed another drive in your system? Is that something we did for you?""

**$User:** ""No, I went out and bought one and put it in myself. The 512 GB in there wasn't big enough since I'm a developer.""

**$Me:** (another lengthy pause, still trying to process the addition of another SSD) ""Well, realistically, it shouldn't cause a bluescreen issue but you're really not supposed to be changing stuff on your system. That sort of thing needs to be approved and performed by us.""

**$User:** ""Oh...okay. I'll take it out and see you in about half an hour.""

\*End call\*

When he arrived on-site I ended up having to do a bit more than just plugging his system into the network and giving it a moment to sync. First, it wouldn't sync because when he tried signing in under his profile, it said the domain trust relationship had been lost. So I signed in with the local admin account - known only to the techs - and tried getting online. That failed because he had set a static IP on it from his home network...another facepalm (leave it on DHCP people!!). Once he removed that I rejoined it to the domain and all was happy.

I advised him to leave the second drive out for a few days and see if the system bluescreens again. Then I told him if that does fix it and he needs more storage capacity, let us know and we could work something out with him, that maybe we could get him a larger SSD and reimage it appropriately.  Otherwise he'd have to use external storage and not go dinking around with his company-issued laptop.

I know it shouldn't at this point but it continuously astounds me as to how people think that the laptop we provide to them for work can be used and messed with any way they please! It's bad enough they store gigs and gigs of pictures of little Timmy's birthday party, and the family vacation, and whatever other non-work related nonsense...but to be so bold as to modify the system without letting us know? That's ballsy.

TL;DR: User calls in reporting a password issue, then proceeds to tell on himself that he installed a second drive on his own in his company-issued laptop without authorization."
talesfromtechsupport,"I worked for a big multi-national company several years ago, only in a low-level grunt position. I was hired for one specific task, but I was occasionally told to do some other miscellaneous tech support things. I was mostly assigned to do work in the offices in my local area, but I would do tickets remotely for people when they related to my  specific focus.

One day, I got a ticket from a guy in Indiana. Some issue with an Oracle database or something, it absolutely not my specialty. Nonetheless, I figured I'd try to help the guy. I shot him an email and an instant message....and he never replied except at really weird times. Eventually he stopped responding, so I closed out the ticket.

...only for him to re-open it again. So, I shot off emails and instant messages, never got a reply during my office hours, and ended up closing it, and he'd re-open it again. I did try harder and harder to help him, I even got a few phone calls with him, but the quality was absolute garbage and I could never understand him through his thick accent. 

Eventually, I take a look at the ticket's details, noting the location of IN. I then realized that IN did not stand for Indiana, but it in fact stood for India. I then transferred the ticket to the correct person in India, explained what had happened, and realized that my co-worker was right about what he said about the guy who assigned me that ticket in the first place."
talesfromtechsupport,"So, a couple of years ago I was doing phone support for a firewall product.  It was a pretty nice place to work, and the customers tended to be pretty technical so their questions actually made me think, which is a nice change from a lot of support roles I've been in.

I get a call one day from a gentleman whose case is titled something like ""Help opening ports for ip phones"" which was a super common sort of call.  He asks me to set up a remote session, and we get that set up and I can see he's already in the firewall management interface so I am looking forward to a pleasant few minutes and then closing out the call.

So I ask him, ""Exactly which ports did you need opened up?""

""I need ports 1000 to 65535, tcp and udp, bidirectional""

""On your perimeter firewall""

""Yes""

...

So I think for a second, and I ask him

""Did your vendor happen to send you a list of the ports you needed open?""

And he pulls up Outlook and he shows me the email from <IP telephony vendor>, and it is asking for exactly what he asked for.  Every port above 1000, open to the world.

This is where I started to panic a little, because while I am not certain how to best explain to him that this is not a good idea I am certain that it is NOT a good idea and yet he is already in the management interface and we are about six mouse clicks and a little typing away from making his firewall functionally worthless.

And then I look at his customer record and I see that his email address is something like it\_admins@<domain> and this is obviously a mailbox that is going to be read by, with any luck, every IT guy they have.

""Sir, would you mind if I took a couple of minutes and just put the steps to accomplish this into an email for you?""

""Oh sure that would be fine.""

So we end the call, and  write up an email thanking him profusely for contacting <firewall manufacturer> tech support, and summarizing his request, and noting that this request is per the email he received from <ip telephony vendor> and then providing the steps to do exactly what he wanted with a little note about how unusual this sort of thing is, and then I send it to the it\_admins email address and pray.

A few minutes later, I get a terse email from a different guy at <domain> thanking me for my support and telling me to close the case.

To this day, I'm not certain it got seen by the right eyes.  But I am still hopeful."
talesfromtechsupport,"This was about 7 or 8 years ago I think. I was working retail on the tech floor of a office store and on some days I would also work the on site tech support counter if that guy was sick or something. I sold an apple thunderbolt monitor to a middle aged lady who made me Promise her it would be as simple as plugging in the cables and it would work. It was why she was getting the thunderbolt version instead of the minidysplayport version which had 1 more cable to plug in I believe. We checked which Mac book she had by looking at her purchase history with our store.  I normally never gave flat out promises because I knew all to well how easily customers can fuck stuff up but I she really insisted and I just couldn't see anything that could wrong after asking her some questions about her set up. 

Of course about 45 minutes later the lady called the tech support counter in a mad frenzy so they called me over because they heard me make the promise and so they felt I should deal with this. 
After taking the phone I had to wait about I got a tirade about how I told her how it was going to be sooooo easy and now she did everything right according to her and and the screen wasn't showing anything. I tried to politely as I could ask if she also plugged in the the power and turned on the power switch. Which cost me another 5 minutes on a lecture on how she isn't stupid. In the back in my head I was thinking great just my luck I sold her one that's broken o well let's check my basis and run through some stuff to see if there is anything out of the order. After having confinced her to describe to her physical set up and nothing being wrong there i got her to open her system preferences so we could check if anything was wrong there. We ran through the screen panel and everything seems fine. At this point she mentioned the screen was just purple. I asked what she did before it turned purple. She tells me it had been purple from the moment she plugged in her MacBook. Aperantly I had missed understood what she meant by the screen not showing anything. I tried asking her to discribe the screen to me. Is there any text on it? She just keeps replying to every question by no it's just purple. Meanwhile I'm Google like crazy if anybody has ever encountered a purple screen on Mac assuming it's some weird blue screen alternative I have never heard of. but I can't find anything. Then the lady starts screaming her MacBook has turned purple too! Now I'm sweating the fuck did I do? We just looked at some screen settings. O God. After some horrible minutes of cursing on the other end of the line I ask her to please describe the screen in as much detail as she can again. ( At this point some of the tech support guys have picked up a phone to listen in and I see them laughing there asses of). She starts it's just purple with white dots a bit like a stary sky..... Suddenly I realize by purple screen she means her desktop background. 

Turns out she never quite a program and haddent really seen her desktop since she bought it. She just need to drag a window to the new screen. Everything had been working this hole time. When her MacBook turned purple she had I think made the gesture for show desktop because Al her apps had hidden. 

So I tip my had to all you people who work in tech support full time and know how to cut through the bull shit. I certainly did not and made this a whole lot more difficult than necessary."
talesfromtechsupport,"For context, I work in the public sector at a US state department. Our network can't seem to handle when a user changes their Office password, so Outlook issues are aplenty right now.  I'm desktop support, but I've been asked to sometimes work service desk due to call volume.  Here's an encounter from the other day from a user describing my ""magical email powers"".

""Thank you for call the service desk, this is Epidexipetyrx.""

User: ""Hi uhhh, my email hates me and I need to get in.""

Me: ""Alright, what is your username and email address""

*User gives info*

""Alright, looks like your password might be expired and my co-workers have reported that Outlook isn't updating after logging in for some folks"". 

We proceed to go through the rigamarole of a password reset and having the user sign out and back in.

""Looks like your able to login in now and your email should update. I also ran a repair on your .OST file just in case.""

User: ""Oh my God, thank you. I've been fighting this stupid think since Friday. You're like an Outlook Witch for this.""

""I guess I am!"" Call ended there.

I've been called lots of things working support, both good and bad, but never ""Outlook Witch'."
talesfromtechsupport,"I finally get to post here after getting my Security+ and spending a mere 4 months at a 4 letter government agency as a tier 1. As you can imagine our job was to weed out the low level issues that could be solved without bugging the local teams. We were a new shop on a new contract as part of a cost savings plan. Needless to say we didn't have the access we needed to do our jobs right.



I had a couple hard to work with customers that made it difficult to accomplish anything, but this customer took the cake during our 2 hour phone call to resolve Outlook issues...

C: Customer

Me: Me



Me: Thank you for calling the service desk. Can I please get your name and number incase we get disconnected?

C: *Says name as quickly as possible and then immediately jumps into his problem* Outlook doesn't look right. I can't read anything. Now what are we going to do about this?

Me: What do you mean Outlook doesn't look right? Was it able to login and are you receiving emails?

C: Yes I'm logged in. I can't see all the information I usually can. Now what are we going to do about this?


This goes on for about a half hour, usually ending in ""What are we going to do about this?"", before I finally get him to say that his subject lines are only showing a few words before moving on to the main email.

Me: Alright sir, so lets go ahead and go into the view tab and reset everything.*Run him through adjusting his view settings*

C: That didn't fix anything.

Me: My only other solution is to delete your profile and create a new one. Lets go ahead and exit Outlook and pull up the Control Panel.

C: I'm not deleting my profile, I have everything the way I like it. Now what are we going to do about this?


During this time I've tried multiple ways to get him to take a screenshot of his desktop as I can't even fathom what could be wrong. I finally broke with protocol and gave him my personal Jabber so that I could screenshare with him. I was not prepared for all the emails to be in like 40 point font. You couldn't read anything at all and while resetting the view settings should have addressed this even without me knowing, it was still there. At the two hour mark I sent the ticket off to his local team so they could convince him to recreate his profile. 


I learned a lesson that day, and I'll let you know if I figure it out beyond needing a drink after work some days. I've learned more about Outlook these past few months than I ever did during the 10 years I've had to use it. I'll never understand how they break things so badly..."
talesfromtechsupport,"A looong time ago VMware ESXi 5.x had this bug: [https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2059053](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2059053) i.e it could crash if you run a VM with intel E1000e NICs instead of VMXNET3.

The funny thing here is that if you see a PSoD message that somewhere contained text 'E1000' it usually was that bug. Actually that bug was really 'popular' for some time.

At the time this happened I know of the bug, I knew what patch I'd have to install but - all VMs were using VMXNET3 so its not urgent.

You probably already guessed it: I was wrong.

So suddenly several VMs were unreachable. Check iLOs... one ESXi down with E1000e PSOD. WTF. Restarted, checked VMs... and there's one that I don't recognize that uses E1000e.

I go investigating and find somebody is testing OS deployment and since he hasn't figured out yet how to deploy VMs with VMware Tools drivers he chose E1000e. I thell him thats bad, there's a bug, it will crash the host, don't do this.

Back to work.

20 Minutes later - VMs down again. Check host - E1000e PSoD again. 

Me: ""What are you doing ?'""

Guy: ""I'm still testing OS deployment of course. Thats my job !""

Me: ""Um... there are some other people in the building who actually also would like to do THEIR jobs which is a bit difficult when production systems go down every 20 minutes....""

We did patch he hosts in the evening. And I googled how to get VMXNET3 drivers that he can use.

TL,DR: PTSD from PSoD."
talesfromtechsupport,"LTR, FTP. This one goes way, way, way back. Like.. some of you guys weren't even born yet.

So ages ago, I did tech support for a dialup ISP (this was in the late 90s).  I was also kinda known as the helldesk wizard when it came to modem init strings. 

I had run a multiline dialup BBS for years on subpar lines, and sometimes needed to limit the maximum speed that my modems could connect at after it rained (otherwise calls would constantly drop, or the modems would constantly resync ( I ran external modems, so I had a visual indication of when they were trying to resync).  It was either cut the speed down a bit and get a stable connection, or let it auto-negotiate and keep dropping or resyncing.

I already knew the ISP was about to do a round of ""layoffs"" (they found bullshit reasons to fire about half of the helpdesk instead of doing layoffs, but I disgress.. and yes, I wound up being included in that eventually).

Enter Angry Caller.  He's immediately on a tirade about how he hasn't been able to keep a stable connection for several months, nobody has been able to help him, blah blah blah. This was when 56k modems were popular; I noticed his modem was connecting consistently at lower speeds (but random ones), and the disconnect reasons were always just LOST CARRIER. He's threatening to cancel.

I knew I was about to get fired anyway, so I had lost my filter already. I just asked him ""so why are you still with us if the other techs haven't been able to fix it?"". He just stopped dead in his tracks, said "".... wow. Nobody has ever talked to me like that before."" I told him I was pretty sure I knew what the issue was, and knew how to get it working, if he would give me a chance, and promised to follow up.  I told him there was a phone line issue somewhere between him and us, likely his inside wiring, but I could see what speed he'd been connecting at and that it was constantly dropping. I told him if we changed the modem init string to force the modem to max out at a speed a notch lower than what his modem was usually connecting at, we could probably get a stable connection.

I pulled some kind of crazy modem init string out of my ass that capped him around.. 32k I think? I walked him through entering it into Windows 95. We hung up, I watched him dial in several times. Every time, the modem connected at the same speed. No disconnects that weren't initiated by him (this was back when PPP was the main way of connecting to your ISP).  I called him back an hour later and asked how it was working. He was no longer Angry Caller, he was Ecstatic Caller. With the max speed cut down, he was getting much higher speeds overall, and a stable connection. No drops at all. We tried bumping it up to the next speed cap, but it started dropping occasionally, so back down it went.

I kept an eye on his account for a few more weeks, the only call he made after that was to get help with his email client (after multiple calls a week for over a month about the connection dropping). I even shot him a few emails to make sure it was still working properly. Yup. Told him if/when he runs a new line from the dmarc to the phone jack, he could do away with that init string and get better speeds, but I don't think he wanted to spend the money to have a new line run.

I last checked his account the day before I got let go. Still no other calls, still connecting reliably."
talesfromtechsupport,"OK, this one is all me...

I was brand new to the telecom world and was setting up cell sites. Having come from the point of sale industry I was still a bit unclear on best practices in the telecom world.

I was installing point to point microwave DS-1 connections to hub the sites in.

Got to one site and its an unusual setup compared to the ones I had been doing. 

I needed to test the link. The switch used RJ-45 but the cabinet routed it via a wire wrap terminal array. Not a punch panel.

Problem was I was 100 miles from my office and I did not HAVE a wire wrap tool.

What I did have was a couple of RS-232 connector kits. So I grabbed a patch cable, stripped off one end, and soldered the female RS-232 pins to the ends of the wires. The slid perfectly onto the wire wrap pins and the link was good, no errors. I figured once the other techs (with the correct tool) showed up to site I would swap it out with a proper wrap job.

Unfortunately it was a very long day and I completely forgot about it until I was halfway home. By then the site had been accepted and turned up so shutting it down again would have required another site visit and some scheduled down time in the maintenance window (middle of the night to oh my god-thirty). So discretion being the better part of valor, I kept my mouth shut. They accepted the site so its their problem now.

As far as I know that site stayed with that half-assed bodge until they upgraded it to 3G."

I walk back to my cubicle, looking over my shoulder for other ghosts of gigs past. I've realized I'm about to be late for a call- the ""Security Logging Project"", whatever that is. I might learn something.  
  
  
I don't.  
  
  
  Or at least I learn that standup calls at LC are like wandering into a circle of _very_ old friends at a party, telling stories from back in the day. There's an unfamiliar shorthand, but the structure and plots are familiar. People are going around and giving statuses on projects described by acronyms or project numbers. I listen for tone and ignore the particulars. Some projects are dragging and blamestorms are brewing. I'm imagining this call has spawned at least three prep meetings for various groups as well as countless chat sessions with rude comments and shitty memes.  
  

Then I hear about the mythical audit report. People blurt out a few numbers and I pay more attention.   
  
I take notes like I'm some junior agent in the Committee for State Security in 1970's Bulgaria on the numbers station beat- maybe I'll eventually learn what all this gibberish means, but I may get called on it arbitrarily.  
  
  
There is a fair amount of discussion on an Identity Store(IS), which has resulted in a bunch of findings, numbered 32 to 40. Some poor bastard on this call is still confused whether or not IS will supplement or replace their fairly complex Active Directory infrastructure.  
  
  
Now the yelling starts. At least two different voices are arguing that IS was supposed to go live several weeks ago and the pro-IS faction claiming that even late, it's going to be awesome.  
  
  
The call ends. I look up the IS application. Instead of licensing someone else's product, Large Client's rolling their own. And it's, well, *special*. Like some hostile looking fruit, the outside is spiky with APIs supporting all the systems that LC needs.   
  
The middle is the infrastructure of moving authorizations and requests around. There are transaction engines, logging engines and a ring of systems to just translate messages between components.   
  
The Vault in the center holds all the data.   
  
  
Every description of The Vault reads like a brochure written in doge. It's all awkward promises without any technical details. Somehow it describes that all the data is held in 'private cloud blockchain registers'.   
  
  
I search my email for tickets regarding the Vault. Lots of backlogs, it seems. Ian's assigned to some of these tickets. I can't see what they're involving, since I don't have access to the ticketing system.  
  
  
After all this, I decide to go home.  
   
  
The next day, I roll in a little before my first call. Per a late night email, I'm to stop by IT to pick up my LC laptop, so I grab coffee and start there.  
  
  
LC's IT Equipment Dispensing Center(tm) is in the basement, which shares space with Shipping and Receiving. It's all wire cages, bare concrete and boxes of various sizes.  
  
  
Hand written signs are a bit confusing so I have to ask an openly hostile woman at the loading dock. She jabs a begloved hand in the direction of IT.  
  
  
Ever wonder where stained, worn out and mismatched cubicles go to? At LC, they're here. It's less cube maze and more Tricks and Traps from Doom II. Cube walls vary as I walk about to find the right person who has my LC laptop.  
  
  
I find the Equipment Dispensing Center a popular place. There's a plastic chain and a few other people waiting in line. The guy at the front is wearing tan pants with a few extra pockets, a Smedium T-shirt in olive green with a low contrast American flag, a boonie cap and wraparound sunglasses.   
  
He's talking at a young woman waiting behind him. She's engrossed in her phone and wearing earbuds.  
  
  
  
Smedium:""I have to be ready to go at a moment's notice""  
  
  
Engrossed woman:"" ""  
  
  
A muffled voice yells from the other side of a mouse colored cubicle wall:""Ian""  
  
  
Smedium walks over and after a minute or two of signoffs, takes a cheap black laptop bag from behind a counter and walks out of the cube wall maze.  
  
  
Well. Ian seems to have made some changes.  
  
  
About fifteen minutes later, I've moved to the head of the line and introduce myself to a short woman whose eyes have seen things.   
  
  
I show her a ticket ID on my phone. She turns to the desktop in front of her, poke about on the keyboard for a few minutes, then get up, walk over to a library cart filled with identical, cheap laptop bags. She selects one bag, scans the tag on the handle and hands the bag to me.   
 
  
Bag feels light. I open it up and there's a power supply, a shoulder strap and no laptop. I show the woman behind the desk and she goes from sullen boredom to confusion to annoyance. I share her annoyance, but for different reasons. I've got two minutes to find some place quiet to attend a call.  
  
  
Woman:""Can you wait a little bit while I figure this out?""  
  
  
me:""Sorry, not really. I'll leave this bag here and you can email me when you have figured out what's going on""  
  
  
  
Woman:""But I checked out the bag. That's yours""  
  
  
me:""You want me to take an empty bag just to make it easier for you?""  
  
  
I get a blank stare in response.  
  
  
Fine. I take the bag and find what looks like a quiet corner outside to dial in to my first call of the day.  
  
  
The call starts with the usual chatter- who we're waiting for, how everybody's doing. This meeting makes sense to me. We're talking credit card handling. I occasionally lean in and try to make recommendations to make things better.  
  
  
The participants have a debate about holding credit card numbers for re-occurring purchases without customer involvement. I talk encryption. A hyperkinetic person named Aarush is violently agreeing with me about the need to encrypt _everything_ and that we can leverage his Identity Store capabilities.  
  
  
  
I make the mistake of opening my mouth.  
   
  
me:""Handling credit card processing expands the scope and expense of PCI compliance. You've just made the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) your entire company""  
  
  
Aarush:""But it's all encrypted in the blockchain""  
  
  
me: I want to explain in detail how bad this idea is, but I know to not go into technical details until I understand them. Expecially not on a project management call. I collapse my comments to a terse:""There are several reasons why that's a *bad* idea, but that's better detailed on a smaller call.""  
  
  
  
I let the call move into other directions and stop paying attention until I hear my name again.  
  
  
Howard (the product owner):""LawTechie will work with Aarush and his team to work out a solution""   
 
  
  
me:""Uh?""  
  
  
Aarush:""That's great! I'll have you work with the lead engineer, Ian""  
  
  
I look at myself, standing in the grass in front of LC's office building, holding an empty laptop bag. I see my bike. I should just go, get my helmet and ride away.     

  
I don't.  
   
  
  
To be continued..."
talesfromtechsupport,"I once worked as a programmer for a company that wrote banking software and they wanted me too connect a telephone headset to to the software suite for outgoing calls. It was actually pretty fun to write, they gave me a Plantronics headset and told me to plug the phone into a phone jack that was connected to an unused number.

One day I'm happily coding away and I hear a strange sound I never heard before. I looked around and found that the headset was ringing. I put it on and ""hello?"" The person on the other end had dialed a wrong number.

From then on the headset would ring once or twice a day and I'd happily answer it, ""Good afternoon, wrong number."" People would thank me and hang up. One day I got the call I had been waiting for.

""Good afternoon, wrong number""
  ""How do you know I dialed the wrong number?""
""This phone is connected to a line where we don't receive incoming calls and don't give the number out""
  ""That doesn't matter! You don't know what number I was trying to call so maybe this is the number I was calling!""
""Okay, what number where you trying to call?""

talesfromtechsupport,"This story took place about 6 years ago, and it was my second week into a new job with a web hosting company.

I'd taken a call from a customer - we'll call her Karen - about some problem with the hosting service she had with us.  I took a look and determined that whilst there was an issue, the fault lay with her CMS and wasn't anything we would fix.

Me:  ""I'm sorry Karen, the issue is to do with WordPress, and unfortunately we can't assist with fixing this.  However, I can send you some links which may help you fix it, or you can ask your developer to look into it further"".

Karen: ""That's not good enough! I'm paying you $10 a month and I expect you to fix problems like this, not tell me to go away and deal with it myself"".

Me: ""I'm sorry you feel that way, however that $10 pays for the server space.  We'll gladly help fix anything server side that's interfering with the proper operation of your site, but we're not responsible for the software itself.""

Karen: ""WE'LL IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIX IT JUST DELETE MY FUCKING ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW""

Me: ""Ok, I can do that, but it may be easier ---""

Karen: ""STOP ARGUING WITH ME DELETE MY ACCOUNT CLEARLY MY $10 A MONTH MEANS SHIT TO YOU GO ON HURRY UP AND TERMINATE MY ACCOUNT IF YOU DON'T VALUE ME AS A CUSTOMER""

Me: ""I can do that for you, before I do, I need to ask if you have a backup of your data, as once I process this it's gone for good""

Karen: ""NO JUST DELETE MY ACCOUNT NOW I EXPECT AN EMAIL TELLING ME IT'S DONE \*click\*""

She'd hung up, and I sat there wondering what to do.  I thought about sitting on it, but she was quite clear in her instructions: delete her account.  Karen had already run through the identity verification questions and had requested (demanded) a cancellation.  I took a backup of her account as insurance, and processed the termination.  I also created a ticket, with appropriate notes and emailing Karen to tell her that her termination request had been taken care of.

I went home not long after that, but the next day I came in to work and was immediately called in speak to manager.  It turned out that Karen was notorious for this shit - she'd demand we do things beyond our scope, and scream and cry and threaten until someone said ""Ok, we'll do it"".  She'd gotten used to other staff members doing whatever she demanded that she expected we bend over backwards.  If she ever heard the word ""no"" she'd threaten to cancel and go elsewhere.

It seemed that other reps had just fixed whatever problem in order to stop her tantrums and get rid of her.  I was the first in a long time to tell her no, and the only one who had ever followed through on actually terminating her account.

Manager: ""You're not in trouble, don't worry.  You did everything correctly.  I've had Karen on the phone all morning squawking about her website.  Oh, btw, did you happen to take a backup of her account?""

Me: ""Yep, it's on my computer""

Manager: ""Delete it and pretend it never existed""

And that's the story of how I destroyed Karen's business website."
talesfromtechsupport,"This was a few weeks ago, as many of my clients were beginning to work from home.

I received a call from a client, she was in no way a senior member of the company, just a typical employee who was working from home. She was connecting to a terminal server using RDP over a VPN to work.

She was frantic, like seemed almost panicked saying she couldn't print to her home printer. She was very angry and extremely rude demanding I fix this immediately. We'd provided her with a laptop to work from home which hadn't been configured to her home printer.

Our company policy considers allowing home kit such as printers that were not provided by us to be a change request, primarily because configuring unsupported kit is billable, so I passed the ticket to the relevant team to contact her management and approve 1. That she's allowed to print at home and 2. That they're willing to pay us to set it up.

She was very unhappy I wouldn't just 'make it work' and had that 'why can't you just fix it?' mentality. I explained to her it was policy and unfortunately I had to respect it as she respects her company policies, which she wasn't happy about but I think she realised she wasn't going to get anywhere arguing with me.

20 minutes later this woman calls back, saying being unable to print is completely stopping her from working. I was able to again appease her saying I'd see if there was an update and get back to her soon.

Typically a request like this takes at least a day to seek relevant approval from the client and to go through a proper process when coming from an employee and not someone in the company that has authority, although the delay is usually in hearing back from the client.

My manager called me shortly after the 2nd call and asked if she was being rude to me. Apparently the woman's manager had asked this question (I'd not mentioned anything). I explained it as I said here, perhaps downplayed slightly, she wasn't exactly pleasant or polite, but did seem quite frantic and blunt is what I said. He let me know he might have to pull the recording, I guess they'd had problems with her before.

I received a message from my manager saying the client has advised there's no reason this woman needs to print from home, and that her manager would speak to her directly and would let us know if they found a reason she'd need this.

2 days later she called back ""I found a workaround to my printing issue, I forward the documents (confidential business information) to my personal email and print them from my personal laptop, but the formatting is all wrong, why does it look weird when I print it? You need to fix this!"" Alarm bells go off in my head. ""I'll get a ticket raised for you and have an engineer call you back"" I say, pretending to be a call handler just to get her off the phone. I tell my manager what she told me. He was not impressed and said he'd take it up with the higher ups at the client company.

The next day I received her leaver form. Close account and access with immediate effect. Laptop to be posted back to us to be wiped.

No idea what was wrong with the formatting from her home laptop, or if she was deliberately trying to steal information or just being unbelievably negligent even after having it explained to her (apparently by both her and my manager) why this was bad. I'm just happy this Karen is no longer with the company."
talesfromtechsupport,"A small tale from my old workplace (It's my old workplace for one than one reason).

After suffering a minor data breach which involved a user (manager) entering all of their login details on a fake website (this is a whole other story maybe for another time) we decided to introduce a third party login authentication system as clearly an incompetent user would just bypass anything internal anyway. 

We opted for an app people can download on their phones and simply press accept when prompted to. In order to link the app to the database we just needed to enter their phone numbers, phone numbers and other personal data is already in the database and we have full access to as stated in the terms of employment. 

So I send out an email to ask people to confirm whether or not their phone numbers were still correct to we may proceed. 

Fast forward an hour I have been called into a meeting with the heads of department, they are angrily demanding to know how and why I have their and their department member's personal information. I explain what I have already explained in the above paragraphs.

&#x200B;

No No No this is not good enough and we should explicitly hand out a permission form to each member of staff instead to ask for permission (again this is something we DO NOT need to do in this particular workplace). Reluctantly we agree and hand out the forms.

&#x200B;

2 weeks later we have received 87 of the 400 ish forms we need to go ahead with the authentication system, we again email the staff explaining we need these. We receive about 20-30 more over the next few days.

&#x200B;

I'll skip a few more back and forths between myself and the departments. So a month later the main manager of the orgnisation comes to the IT department, furious. ""IT WHAT AM I PAYING YOU FOR, WE APPROVED THE APP MONTHS AGO (it was a month) THAT IS ALREADY COSTING US A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE DOING NOTHING"" . I am very good at talking with people so the rest of the department usually just leave me to deal with the ""PR"" side of things, not this time chief. 

&#x200B;

I lost the plot, simply said to him ""You can speak with the rest of the team and once you have realised how unprofessional both yourself and the other departments have been you can come back to me, I'm going for my break.""

&#x200B;

The app was never implemented, I left soon after."
talesfromtechsupport,"This is from about 2005 or 2006.  We had a customer for our very small (think city wide \~ 300,000 in the city) ISP.  We get a call from a user who's username is let's say ""ignorant\_wanker"".  They were complaining that there was an somebody using the email address of [""ignorant\_wanker@aol.com](mailto:""ignorant_wanker@aol.com)"".  

They demanded we stop this other person from impersonating them.  We tried our best to explain that we have no control over other ISP's and you are allowed to use the same username at different domains for email addresses.  This person called back 3 or 4 times  and talked to several agents who all explained the same thing.

When the calls stopped, we all had a laugh and went on about our lives.  Afew days later, we started getting calls that users were getting bounce backs from AOL when they sent emails and they were being rejected.  


We contact AOL and find out that have black listed our domain because ignorant\_wanker, no happy with the explanation we gave them started emailing and harrassing [ignorant\_wanker@aol.com](mailto:ignorant_wanker@aol.com) demanding that they give up the email address.  This lead to AOL blocking domain and many many unhappy customers as AOL was still a player in the webmail scene.  


Finally AOL agrees to unblock us if we have a talk with our problem user and stop the abuse.  Turns out the VP of customer service and the legal counsel for the ISP had to call the customer to get things straightened out.  I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall.  I think the user terminated service either willingly or forcefully within a month."
talesfromtechsupport,"I work for a software development company. The software we make is free, but the content in it - books - are subscription based

Today I've got a message from my boss:  
B: *Hey, can you try and open a book on an iPad? It's article number is TH-123-ABC.*

TH stands for Thai-language book.

Me: *Sure.*

I grabbed an iPad, opened our software, logged in, searched for the book, it opened without a hitch.

Me: *It works, what's the problem?*  
B: *A client of ours subscribed for this book, but he's getting errors about expired licences.*  
Me: *Strange, but it works on my account*  
B: *Try a test account*

Yeah, good idea, mine is a company superaccount, has access to all the books. Took a dumb test login, subscribed for the book, and it opened.

Me: *Still works*

After a few other checks, tries and futile solutions, everything looked absolutely perfect. We even ask the customers' permission to try it with his account. He gave permission, I logged in, and the licence was valid on my computer. On his: expired.

I couldn't help much further, so I went on with my other tasks, while my boss tried to help the client. An hour later I've got a message from him:  
B: *I've got it. It turned out Thailand uses a different calendar. Currently it's year 2563. So his licence for the year 2020 DID expire. 500 years ago.*"
talesfromtechsupport,"TL;DR at bottom

I work the IT service desk at a medium size office complex.  We recently changed the vendor of our ticketing system and as such we also decided to change how users could submit tickets.  With the old system, the floor lead or supervisor of a department could submit a ticket on behalf of a user.  This was great because it prevented a lot of unnecessary tickets from being created.  One of our company values is discernment and management decided to allow all employees the power to make good judgement decisions by letting everyone submit their own tickets.  As such, my team and I have received some tickets that leave us rolling on the floor laughing and other tickets leave us asking ourselves “just... how...?”.  The following is one such fantastic nugget from an end user:

One day we were crunching the ticket queue and as I had finished with my current pile, I went out to the open queue for more tickets. I saw this one ticket titled “Can you fix crazy?”.  Intrigued, I clicked on it and read the body of the ticket.  It read as follows (and is formatted exactly how the user submitted it):

“I’m hearing sounds.

Dings.

Every time I back space too many times.

Help.”

That was the ticket. I just stared at my screen, stunned that this was actually a ticket. When I told my team that someone wanted us to fix crazy, my coworkers thought the same thing I did; that a user’s laptop was ‘acting crazy’ and they needed it fixed.  Then my teammates read the ticket and we all just stood around my workstation and busted up laughing for a moment.  As an aside, this ticket is one syllable away from a haiku and yes, we did take time to count the syllables. Our tier II wanted the ticket because he thought it was funny; I did not want the ticket because I thought it was petty so it worked out great. 

So you know that ding sound that Windows makes when you backspace too much? Well, I later learned that the user wanted that specific Windows sound to be turned off.  However, she wanted the rest of the Windows sounds to be left on.  The best my coworker could come up with was to turn off the Windows alerts that corresponded with that sound; it would turn off the backspace ding as well a few other benign ID10T alert dings. I’m told she didn’t like that answer and demanded another technician. She literally told my coworker, tier II A, “I’m done with you”.  The other tier II we have is very nice but his troubleshooting skills are somewhat lacking; I’m told he actually got promoted out of pity.  Anyway, she wanted tier II B to fix her issue, so off it went to tier II B.  He essentially did what tier II A was planning to do and told her the exact same thing that tier II A did.  She was still huffy but since the answer to the fix was consistent, she reluctantly agreed. To date, I haven’t heard anything more about it so I’m guessing that all is well that ends well.

The moral of the story: no, you cannot fix crazy.

TL;DR: User submitted a ticket in the form of an almost-haiku requesting a specific sound setting that is native to Windows to be turned off while leaving the rest of the Windows sounds turned on.  The “fix” was to turn off the sound alerts that corresponded with the specific sound.  The user didn’t like the “fix”, pitched a fit, and finally relented to the “fix”. And to answer the question in the title, no, you cannot fix crazy."
talesfromtechsupport,"This feels like something every IT person can get a good groan out of, so here goes.

About three years ago now, I was working for a MSP. Most of our clients were health professionals of some sort or another. There's a whole slew of stories I could tell about that, but the one that takes the cake is one I wasn't even witness to.

Basically, one of the dentists who we provided services for was having an issue with a server we installed. Everyone but the boss was already out or otherwise spoken for, so the boss saddles up to go take care of things. When he arrives in the server room, he finds the client standing there, having apparently just straight-up unplugged the server.

""I just wanted to speed things up.""

Anyway. Boss got it fixed, but anyone who says the customer is always right has never worked IT or retail. "

talesfromtechsupport,"Hi, This is another story about working Tech Support for a large retail company. 

Backstory: A customer who said he works for the major corporate office of the product we sale/repair. Was having an issue with his phone's OS and demanded a replacement. He'd also would like to transfer 100% of everything from one phone to the replacement (documents, pictures AND the corrupted OS).  The thing is, if you have bad software and you mirror it from a bad backup and put it onto the replacement, its going to continue with that same problem from the previous device.

I'd also would like to add this the original problem was on his corporate phone (A prototype) and the main corporate office has their own, separate repairs for HQ employees only. But he came to public retail.

&#x200B;

Me: Good afternoon! I will be your technician today. How may i assist you.

Customer: Yeah my phone would force reboot after every 2 hours or so.

Me: I see, what activity is your device doing before it restarts?

Customer: If i run (presentation app) or play (High Performed Game). Hell if i just sit here watching a movie it shuts down.

Me: I see. Have you tried anything on your own before making an appointment? (Just so i don't repeat his steps)

Customer: Only thing i could think of is reinstall the applications but it still restarts. I'm fairly certain its the phone and not the applications. I had it replaced by another one of your stores last week. I'll just have you guy's replace it again. It should be under warranty.

Me: Alright sir. Before we can come to the conclusion of a full unit replacement, i would need to run some tests for the best approach.  


I look into our database based on his name, device serial and so on. The device was in fact replaced the week before coming to us. However, the original he took to the first store had an unusual barcode that i have never seen before. I speak to a manager for guidance. He says, ""Thats a prototype"" and was already replaced from another store in another city.

&#x200B;

The damaged OS however could be traced to the Analytics Data. This will be transferred to any new phone and recreate the issue if he copies everything from his backup to the new phone. We did not have the tools or training to make changes in the Data. Most retail doesn't. Only solution is to start from scratch on a new OS and transfer all info excluding the copied OS. (My explanations are terrible in this context but he can transfer his data separate from the OS) 

I return back to the customer.

Me: Hello Sir, It looks like the first device replaced  was a prototype. If you don't mind me asking. Where did you get this.

Customer: I work in (My companies) corporate office and they have issued me this device.

(Might i add i hear loads of stories that the corporate employees treat the retail of the same company like lower peasants)

&#x200B;

Me: I see. I do know that corporate has a separate repair group that could have repair or replace that system for issues like this. 

Customer: I know but i was not in the area so i just went to the closest store i could find.

Our other stores could have prevented this. But again he goes to the closest store to him. Our hardware scans show that none of the hardware is the issue. No over heating, no damaged components/water damage. Clean as its new hardware.

Me: From the results of diagnostics, it seems this is a software issue not a hardware. Also from the back logs, it shows theres corrupt files in the operating system. Did you do a full backup and restore from the prototype to the replacement?

Customer: Yes, its not the software i know its the hardware.

I try to explain to him for a bit but he does not want to hear it. I then give him the solution that will work.

Me: Ok so our database is pointing to an out of store repair. This will take a few business days to continue diagnosing to see if this is really hardware. But a faster solution for you would be to restart the OS from scratch. You CAN backup and transfer documents, pictures, music and so on and have it all on a non corrupted OS.

Customer: Absolutely not! I need everything on this phone brought to a new phone. I'm a developer, i work at corporate. I would know if it was a programming error! Just get me a manager.

I go and speak to a manager but he is tied up with several customers who need help. He then adds his permissions to bypass the out of store repair and to just replace his phone (for the second time in a week)

Me: Hi. Unfortunately our managers are busy but we have redirected our data to replace your phone as its still under warranty.

Customer: You should have got that done in the first five minutes of talking to me. This is why im in corporate. I know what im talking about.

After i heard that i was feeling a little discouraged as i was trying to get into corporate for 6 months before trying my hand in the retail side. I also didn't believe corporate employees would treat the retail side any different.

Me: Please wait as we bring out your replacement phone.

His OS is fully backed up on the network server. I replace his phone.

Me: Here you go sir. Would you need assistance transferring your previous data to the new phone?

Customer: No i know what to do. Just put my sim card in the new phone.

I do ask he says but issue a last minute comment.

Me: Ok here you go sir. I just would like to remind you, if the same issue happens again, it points to your OS and not the hardware.

Customer: I'm a developer, i know im right.

He leaves and i continue working.

The next day he comes in for the same problem and demands another replacement. I was already in a semi bad mood and didn't want to be stepped on by a customer that day. Before i approached him. I looked at his appointments description.. it was the same problem from yesterday. I asked my manager if we should replace his phone again. He said no and his only options (because it was replaced twice in one week) Is to have a new OS installed, or go a week without his phone as it would need to be sent out for inspection.

I walk to him and start off with a cheery tone.

Me: Welcome i'll be your technician today. What can i do for..

Customer: Yeah yeah you gave me a broken phone. Its the same problem. I want this fixed and i want it done right. Give me a fully working phone.

I took a shot and looked at him with the most serious face and tone i've ever done in my life during a confrontation.

Me: Sir, do you remember me from yesterday?

Customer: Yeah so what?

Me: Do you remember what i said?

Customer: Yeah but i help create this OS i know im right.

Me: Again, do you remember what i said about your corrupted OS?

Customer: Its not corrupted.

Me: Sir, we can give you another never removed from box phone like the first two times. Please understand this is a software issue. If you'd like i can transfer all your data to a known working OS and you can test it in our store (He has free time).

I guess my tone made him agree to test my theory. We transfer all his data to a clean new OS. He stays in the store for two hours as i help other customers. While i finish up another customer i check in with him.

Me: Hello any updates?

Customer: It hasn't rebooted yet. I'm testing everything and making sure i have all my data.

Me: Sounds good. I'll check back in half an hour.

I come back before taking my scheduled break.

Customer: Ok its not doing it but it was random before you replaced it. I need to go but i'll be back when it happens.

Customer walked out and i told my manager the encounter. My manager said with the comments he gave about working in corporate, we could have gotten his employee number and reported him to his corporate manager. Unfortunately i didn't ask for his employee number.

He came back weeks later but with another phone. I wasn't working on it but another tech said it was for another situation (He dropped it in a kitchen sink) but my coworker said the customer was talking about me to him and said. ""Yeah i was here before. He fixed my other phone a while ago""

I guess it was the OS."
talesfromtechsupport,"So I am the youngest person at my work and somehow I have become the tech support skivvy because I have basic computer skills and everyone else seems to be afraid of technology. It's super weird and frustrating, but I try to be as helpful as possible.

This morning I get sent a photo of a web page with this message from B:
""Hey DarlazMIRS, I logged into random sales site this morning and this product belongs to XYZ Sales person. Yet I see my personal contact details are listed on the site. Do you know why that is?""

I look at the photo and see that the item is listed for sale with the contact details of the seller on it. Below it is a ""Contact Me!"" request form, one where you submit your details and the seller calls you back. This is filled with the persons personal information. So just from looking at this, I can't see an issue.

I call the person up to try help.

""Hey there B! I dont understand what the issue is with your question.""

""DarlazMIRS! Thank god. So I'm looking at this site and for some reason my contract details are listed as the seller. But I'm not selling this product!""

""But you aren't listed as the seller...""

""No. Have a look at my photo. All my details are there.""

""Okay.... have you bought something off this site before?""

He pauses. ""Yeah.""

""Okay. So Google saved you information and has prefilled the form for you to contact the seller directly.""

""Really?"" He thinks about it. ""Google can do that?""

And on that magical day, people learned something new about the internet.

TL:DR Google prefilled in some personal information on a sales site contact request form; now person is worried they will be contacted for the product that is on sale."
talesfromtechsupport,"I work as a printer technician, but specifically on connecting customers to a printer or help set them on to scan to email. 

This customer recently had their email server compromised and needed to update their password in their copier so they could scan to email.  Basically, I asked if I could remote into her computer so i could do it from her computer (so someone wouldn't have to head over, changing this call from $45 to $100 for milage).  The website was being blocked by her IT. Well not much I cam do but she asks me If I can disable it or tell her how to disable it.  I know I can't and wont do that without their ITs permission so I ask if she can call her IT to get it approved.  

She responds with ""Are you sure you dont know anyways to disable the security on my computer?  If you were with another customer and they had a popup blocker you would have no way to turn it off?""

At this point I feel I can tell how their email server was compromised, but ignoring that, I responded with ""There is no way I am able to disable the security on her computer without ITs permission""  

She sighed and finally called IT, and they let me remote in and out took 10 minutes to actually fix the problem.  Hopefully I wont have to deal with them again for the next week or so..."
talesfromtechsupport,"Thirty-nine years ago I did telephone tech support for a computer hardware company in San Diego. (Never did on-site visits except for one odd situation that I'll post about another day.)  We made controller boards to connect minicomputers to printers. I was learning on the job do I kept a detailed card file of each user's symptoms and ultimate resolution, so that over time I evolved a paper database of problems mated with solutions.

One of our customers called me because their board had arrived and a physical inspection revealed damage.  I asked  what kind of damage.  He explained it looked like one of the components exploded.  Now that board was working the last time I saw it, so something must have happened in transit.  We sent him a replacement and he shipped the damaged board back.  Customer was happy.

But we were still out the cost of a new board, around $1500 if I recall.  When the damaged board arrived it looked like a crater on the moon.  The component that exploded was a large capacitor.  Almost nothing was left of it.  Burn marks covered most of the board radiating out from the capacitor's location.

We had to badger the shipper for a few days before they admitted that the delivery truck was struck by lightning.  The driver was unharmed so they assumed the cargo was okay too.  We filed a claim and got reimbursed.

As for the board, the director of manufacturing hung it on the wall of the factory.  Every time he gave a tour he told the story."
talesfromtechsupport,"Apr 24: customer submits proper form for waiver in ticket submission application and ticket handling application misroutes it

---jump to TODAY---

Customer calls: got am ETA?

Me: not even an assignee, but I'll reach out

Me: *Reaches out to only person online in the queue the ticket is assigned to*

Guy assigned that queue: nope, why are you asking me about this, send it to OS Security Team

Me: *Reaches out to OS Security person who does this*

Guy who does this: I'm busy talk to my second

Me: *Reaches out to Second*

Second: are you wanting to submit a waiver?

Me: the customer did, they submitted the form in the ticket submission application

Second: I need them to submit the form in the ticket submission application

talesfromtechsupport,"Hello, I use to work tech support at a large retail company. The company was great, fun and at the time i was more hands on when it came to computers but also supported phones.

A customer who seems to be doing very well in the world and said was a very important business man from the middle east. You know, expensive looking suit with a diamond watch and multiple rings. He had damaged his phone and wanted to get it replaced and transfer all data before his important meeting the same day (in about an hour). Rewording it, the companies policy is if we can fix it we will. Due to shortages of the product and wouldn't want to run out for those who have no other choice but to replace it. If we can't fix it, we would gladly replace.

We have a coded system that can only be bypassed by a managers code to replace a device for any serious purpose if there is no other option. Here's the encounter.

&#x200B;

Me: Good morning what seems to be the problem sir?

Customer: Hey i have a cracked display. I dropped it this morning when getting ready for work. I'd like a new one and have everything (512GB worth) transferred before my meeting in an hour.

(It's 11am and he wants it fixed by 12. Take note of the time.)

Me: Thats unfortunate but we'd be happy to replace the display for you and have it done by 12pm (Because we can fix it). Also from our database, it shows you have the extended warranty plan. The display will be replaced for $30. (without warranty its around $300 extra)

Customer: Did you not hear me? I want it REPLACED. Hurry up i have a meeting that i CAN NOT miss.

When he raised his voice a little, i noticed other customers and techs at our table watching our encounter.

Me: Absolutely sir. I understand you'd like to have your phone replaced, but if it is not repairable we'd be happy to..

He cuts me off and answers a call from a second phone he has. He then shoo's me away for a while. I help out a couple more customers but keep an eye on him. Half an hour goes by and he's still on the phone. After i finish with an appointment, i return to his table. Perfect timing as he ended his call. its now around 11:35.

Me: Hello sir, is everything alright?

Customer: No i want a new phone right now.

Me: Sir our policy cannot simply replace the device if it's just the display that needs to be fixed. You would only be charged $30. Unfortunately because of the delay (his phone call), it may not be done till 12:30. We can also hold onto the device for you while you're in your meeting, and can pick it up once your meeting is over. Would this work for you?

Customer: You're not listening. I don't want it fixed. I want it replaced. I don't care how much the screen cost. Why is this hard for you to understand?

As he tapped the table loud enough for everyone at our table can hear. I thought if i added an example with something, it would get my point across.

Me: I understand completely sir. Please tell me in your opinion. If a window in you car is shattered but the rest of the car is in mint condition, would you spend a little to get the screen fixed or purchase a new car.

Customer: This is a stupid question. I'd buy a ""better"" car.

I looked at a customer to the left of him and she was shaking her head in disappointment.

Me: Sir i have also tried to bypass the system and see if we can replace your device, but in the many changes i have done to your file, it only prompts to replace the display. (I answered the system truthfully)

Customer: Then get me your manager, you've already wasted too much of my time.

Me: Yes sir, please hold on a moment.

It's about 15 minutes before his ""Important meeting"". I find one of the managers in the field and explain the situation. He asked if i told him the company policy and how the system works. I said i did but he does not approve this option. I walk one of the managers to the customer. Some customers while their appointment are done, stay to see what happens next.

Me: Hello sir thank you for your patients. This is (Manager1)

Manager1: Hello, my worker has informed me that you'd like your phone to be replaced.

Customer: Yes i don't understand why he cannot simply do this. I don't care how much it costs.

Manager1: I understand, but due to the condition of the device, it does not qualify to have a full unit replaced. As (OP) stated, we can replace the screen for you and with your warranty, it would be no more than $30.

As manager1 tries to explain how the company system works. He cuts off my manager grabs his broken phone and slammed it do the floor screaming

Customer: I want my new phone and i want it now!!

As a loud slam hits the floor, the entire store goes silent. (This was the first time the store was so quiet with a large amount of people in it. This was in a Mall too). While the store was quiet, another manager who's not afraid to speak his mind screamed out.

Manager2: Nothing to see here folks please carry on.

As the sound began to rise again, i looked down at the phone and noticed it was faced down. On the same side that was damaged. I picked up the device and did a cosmetic check to make sure there was no other damage. Surprisingly nothing was damaged other than the display. Now chips of glass was coming off. I thought to myself, this was surprising as he slammed the phone to the ground in anger. I told my manager that it is still in good condition and surprisingly functioning.

Manager1: Sir i must worn you, if you continue to damage the phone, i would have to ask you to leave.

Its now 11:55am

Customer: I'm not going anywhere, i want my new phone.

The customer earlier that was still there with the expression on her face ""This man can't be serious"". My manager pulled me to the side and said

Manager1: I'll take care of this, try to help one more customer then go onto lunch.

I help one more customer and head to lunch at 12pm. As im walking out the store, i see my manager talking with the customer. He should be at his meeting by now. I get off my lunch an hour later. The customer's still arguing. This time, manager 1 and 2 are speaking with him but i continue to help other customers. When i see him walking out of the store its now 1:20pm. He's over an hour late for that important meeting. My manager pulls me aside to speak to me.

Manager1: (OP) don't let this one customer get to you. You've done nothing wrong and things are fine now.

Me: So what was the solution we were able to do for him?

Manager1: He decided to have the display replaced for $30 and will pick it up in an hour.

The man comes back two hours after we called informing his phone is fixed and ready to pick up. I watch as he took his phone and walked out of the store.

Unfortunately the random survey we give out made it to him so he gave me a review.

Customer: ""Worst experience i've ever had im my life. (OP) Refused to give me a new phone after i told him several times i need it replaced before my important meeting. He kept me in the store longer than i needed to be. He even dropped my phone to the ground and said it was an accident! He was the rudest worker at the store and i will never purchase another device from this company again. 1 star!""

My manager informed the other managers who reviewed the survey that the customer was at fault the entire time.  I handled the device with care as i did not want to cut myself from the shattered glass

He came back a month later and purchased the new phone when it was released."
talesfromtechsupport,"A little background.  I work for an ISP.  One of my relatives previously worked for an ISP, for the purpose of the story he’ll be Jay.

I’m off work sick and trying to rest.  Jay and I get a group text message from a mutual friend, we’ll call her Ann, randomly asking us about our family.  It is out of the blue, but not out of the norm with her.  Jay and I both reply to her each giving a brief update.  What is out of the blue is what happened next.

>Ann: Do either of you know anything about putting an end on a wire for a router?

>Me: Crimping an Ethernet?

>Jay: actually yes

>Me: cat5e

>Ann: Can I call one of you?

>Jay: Call Nik

Unfortunately for me Jay knows exactly what happened the first time that I tried to crimp an ethernet cable because he was there for most of my frustrations with threading it.  Jay also knows I’m sick.  I give Jay the bird in my head as I push myself out of bed to go rummage through my tool table.

>Ann: Do either one of you have the crimping tool and ends?  I just tried calling Nik and it went to voicemail.

>Me:  Ann you have my old phone number in your phone still, call the one you’re texting.  Anyway how much patience do you have?

>Ann:  What do you mean?

>Me: Sometimes it’s easier to just buy a new ethernet cable.

>Ann: That’s not what we are trying to do.  Let me call you.


By this point I’ve got my crimping tool out and am squeezing it while contemplating finding an old cable to mangle.  I get her call.


>Ann: Hey Nik, we just got a new router, but I’m not good at explaining this you better talk to Kyle.


Ann puts her husband on the phone.  He starts describing what they are trying to do.  They have a competitor to my employer, but this isn’t the first friend that’s had me troubleshooting this company before.  While the other company runs things a bit different, I start suspecting that Kyle is describing to me their D Mark location.  At this point I am sitting at my desk chair that I use for work at home with pretty much the same look on my face I sometimes have while working.


>Me: Um Kyle what is the model of the device you are replacing?


>Kyle:  I’d have to go downstairs and find out.


A few minutes later he reads off the model.  I run a quick search since its not an approved device for my employer.


>Me: And what is the model of the new router?


>Kyle: It’s an AC1750.


>Me:  Any other markings?  That’s the type not the model.


I get the router model and confirm it is a gaming router.


>Me:  Um Kyle, the reason this won’t work is that the other box isn’t a router, it is a modem with wifi built in.  You can connect the gaming router to it, but the router won’t work without the modem.

>Kyle:  Oh we’re having trouble with the other box running hot.

>Me: Do you rent the modem?

>Kyle: I don’t know Ann handles the bill.

>Me: Do you know what speed tier you have?

>Kyle:  Nothing I see here tells me.  I just know Ann says it is the highest we can get in our area.


>Me:  I’m sending you a list of your providers modems, but you probably want to give them a call.


I put my crimping tool away and head back to bed.  An agent for a competitor owes me and they don’t even know it.

TLDR:  Friend wants me to convert a rj11 coming from their d mark to a rj45 to run their new router that they bought to replace their modem."
talesfromtechsupport,"I know CD-ROM cupholders have jumped the shark. But that’s OK - this is a CD-ROM story, but it’s not a cup holder story. 

One fine day a few jobs back, I’d finished one customer PC so it was time to get the next one off the queue. The attached paperwork had some vague comment about a CD fault. I plugged the box in, fired it up, shoved a test CD in it and started trying it out. 

And found no fault. OK, I’ll try another. Slapped the eject button and ...

... the tray opened. With the CD spinning very very fast. Fast enough in fact that, presumably with a bit of help from being slightly warped, or maybe not I’m not a physicist, it rose about a centimetre off the tray and hovered there for two or three seconds. 

Well I’d sure reproduced the fault now! But it boggles the mind that the customer (or perhaps the service counter) hadn’t found the fault remarkable enough to say explicitly what it was."
talesfromtechsupport,"Ticket: User states they cannot print to their cube printer (user is WFH but HR, so I'm thinking they might go into the office  as needed).

Me: Hi User, still having printer issues?

User: yes

Me: Ok what seems to be the problem?

User: normally I print while I WFH and then when I get into the office it just prints all my stuff, but now I can't see my cube printer.

Me: (thinking about her print queue loading up) Ok, do you have a date you are returning to office or just once this is all over?

User: Once it's all over.

Me: so your plan is to just print to your cube printer until and let them stack up until the return to office order is given?

User: yes, why?

Me:  (screams internally) I'll address that in a moment. What's your printer name?

User: I don't know

Me: ...ok, is it this one that is further down the selection list?

User: no

Me: Ok, here's a list of every printer in the building and their names (uniform name scheme so if she sees hers she should recognize it). Do you see the one you use?

User: IDK

Me: ......

User: It's in my cube, can you go look

Me: I am aware of that. I am not in the office, do you know the name of it?

User: no"
talesfromtechsupport,"This happened in the early 90's. The company I worked for did a lot of service contracts for government offices. They were pretty lucrative as long as not a lot of stuff broke, but when something did break they would call us and we would have to go fix it. If it was the customer's fault they would have to pay an hourly rate of $90/hour/tech.

We got a call from an office in the federal courthouse, a building built at the turn of the 20th century. They said a computer was acting weird; the monitor was pulling to the left, then going back to normal for a second before pulling to the left again. One of our techs did a little troubleshooting with them on the phone, then told them that he's on the way out and should be there within an hour. He grabs a monitor and video card along with his basic trouble kit and heads out.

A couple hours pass and the tech calls in. He said he has tried everything and can't get it to stop shifting left and popping back. He asks me to bring out a new unit. I put together a computer equal to what they have and head out. In the mean time he heads to lunch and we meet at the client's office. Sure enough, the monitor pulls to the left until it becomes a line, then pops back. The other tech is completely flustered. He asks me to take a look.

I spend a little time checking the monitor, the cpu, wiggling cords, shut it down, check all the cards, reseat them, basically all the troubleshooting steps.

These old buildings don't have good power or good air circulation, it's summer so it gets hot in the offices. I'm ready to try moving the workstation to another location to see if it does the same thing there before giving in and giving them a new computer. Then I notice that it feels like something is brushing by my legs, I look down and see nothing. I look behind the desk and see nothing, but something is there. I get down under the desk which is stuffed with old boxes and dust, and then I see it.

The worker had stuck a small oscillating fan under the desk, it was on low so it was making almost no noise whatsoever. Every time it swung to the left the monitor would squeeze up into a line on the left, when it went back to the right the monitor would pop back. I looked at the other tech and said ""watch this"" and turned off the fan. The monitor went back to normal and stayed. The workers were so happy, they started asking what I did, so I pulled the fan out and explained to them how magnetic fields work. They were somewhat embarrassed. We packed up everything, put the original video card back in and filled out the ticket. We did charge them for 2 hours, but only for one tech, since I felt we should have found this faster.

They paid without complaint. That was the first time either of us had ran into an oscillating fan hiding under a desk, under a monitor."
talesfromtechsupport,"Small-town tech support story again. Over the course of my business I had a lot of people with issues with HP printers. They... just wouldn't install. Oh, if you download the software from HP it works but Windows was robust enough to just install what you needed for everything EXCEPT HP printers. But the problem is that users are... users, and don't know the nuances of going to the manufacturer's websites to download the latest software. So, it got to the point where I told any user who called about them to not get one from HP.

User: I need to get a printer. Which one should I get?

Me: I recommend Canon, Brother, Epson, basically anything but an HP. (Note that I've had all of these brands over the years with little to no issues getting them set up.)

User: What about HP?Me: I don't recommend it. I've had other users with issues getting them set up. User: So, a Canon...?

Me: Or Brother or Epson or anything except an HP.

User: Got it. Thanks.

&#x200B;

Fast forward one week.

&#x200B;

User: I'm having trouble setting up this new printer I bought. I plug it in but the computer won't recognize it.

Me: What kind did you get.

User: An HP blah blah. 

Me:...

Me: And what did I tell you last week? (It's nice owning your own tech support because you can't get in trouble for saying stuff like this to users)

User: Not to get an HP?

Me: Right. Okay, I'll be by in about 20 minutes.

&#x200B;

Edited for formatting because I'm still getting used to this."
talesfromtechsupport,"I work internal IT for an independent appraiser. Employees have been working from home for the current apocalypse but I still have to come into the office. The user put in a ticket saying she was unable to connect to her computer in the office so I called her.

Me = Me User = User

Me: Hello this is Me from IT. I saw your ticket, can you explain a bit more?

User: I'm trying to connect in and when I hit connect on the VPN, it gives me an error and then remote desktop says I can't connect.

Me: Ok, well I am unable to see your computer in TeamViewer, does your network icon in the bottom left say connected?

User: Yes but it says no internet access.

Me: Do you have any other devices on your home network? If so, please try opening the internet on one of those devices.

User: My phone is on my wifi and it says no internet access when I open the internet.

Me: Ok, your ISP is likely having an outage in your area.

User: Ok well how are we going fix it. Do I need to reboot my computer? Do I need to bring my computer in?

Me: I can't do anything, it's your ISP that's having an outage. You just need to wait.

User: But I have work to do. How long will it take for you to fix this?

Me: I can't fix anything, this is an issue with your ISP. We have nothing to do with them.

User: But I have work to do. Can you let me know when it gets fixed?

Me: *head becomes acquainted with desk* I will look into this and leave the ticket open. I will only know it's truly fixed when you are able to connect so let me know when you're able to connect. I would say try in about an hour.

User: Wonderful, thank you so much for looking into this, I'll let you know when I'm able to connect. *Hangs Up*

Me: *Says outloud* Did she really think I could fix an ISP outage?

Edit: A good few people are saying that she might not have known what an ISP is, I said to her ISP and then said out Internet Service Provider and asked if she has Verizon or Cox (didn't add it into the story as I figured it was irrelevant, she has Cox by the way) and insisted there was nothing I could do so I just did the whole I'll look into it when in reality, I put the phone down and started playing RuneScape."
talesfromtechsupport,"Someone needed to change their password while working remotely. They are pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del like normal, but that is trying to change the password on their home computer.

$Me: ""OK, instead of Ctrl-Alt-Del, when in Remote Desktop press Ctrl-Alt-End""

$User: ""It's still not working""

$Me: ""Let me remote into your computer to take a look. Here's the address you need to go to""

""No, don't search for it, put it in the address bar""

""No, you don't need to Google it. You need to put it in the address bar at the top of the screen""

\~20 minutes later I manage to walk them through going to a website, putting in a session number, and starting the session. After each time I told them to do something there was a plethora of mumbling half sentences without any indication if they were able to do it or what the problem was before actually responding to me.

$Me: ""I'm connected now."" I press Ctrl-Alt-End. Click change password. They put in their old and new passwords. It works.

It was a challenge to remain calm during that. I am not really mad at them though, part of the issue was that English isn't their first language, and they were being very patient with me as well. Doesn't make it any less frustrating to deal with, but it's the difference between being frustrated with them and frustrated at the situation. But still, it's 2020. How do you not know how to go to a website?"
talesfromtechsupport,"As part of my continuing efforts to drag my business unit, kicking and screaming, into the modern era, I finally convinced them to let me upgrade the non-prod DB servers to RHEL 6. Since they don't want to take any kind of real outage, this means creating a brand new 4 node cluster. I got the servers racked, cabled, and installed. Part of the cabling process is to have the network team provision the ports on the switch. A pair of links for public access, a pair of links for cluster heartbeat, and a pair of 10GbE links for storage. Network team provisions them as virtual port channel groups and puts them on the appropriate VLANs. DBA team does their part by installing and configuring RAC. Everything is setup and ready.

&#x200B;

Until the app team complains that they are able to connect directly to the DB cluster. All DB servers are supposed to be protected by the layer 2 firewall, which restricts access to ONLY app servers.  The solution is pretty simple: the ports just need to be moved to a slightly different VLAN that's behind the layer 2 firewall. The subnet stays the same. I don't have to do anything.

&#x200B;

Network contacts me to let me know that the servers aren't responding. I hop on the console and can't ping the default gateway. mii reports that both links in the bonded pair are up, though. Network asks what kind of bonding it's configured for. Round-robin load balance. He asks that I switch it to LACP, so I change the mode to 802.3ad and bounce the interface. Network reports that the links aren't joining the port channel. Curious. Investigation reveals this to be a bug on Cisco's part. I switch back to round robin, and the link now functions. I can login to each server over its public interface.

&#x200B;

Except we're not done. Network can't hit the TNS listener. I check, and the port is listening on the SCANVIP, not the public interface.  


For those unfamiliar with the way HA systems work, here's a brief overview. Each node has an IP address that's always there. The cluster also has a SCANVIP address that can move from node to node in case of failure. The cluster software controls it, and it is bound as an IP alias on the network interface. Each service in the cluster has its own SCANVIP. We have 3 services, so one node doesn't have a SCANVIP...it's the hot standby.

I can't get to the SCANVIP from my management host. Management system is supposed to be allowed on the firewall. A quick check reveals that when I bounced the network interface, the cluster saw this as a failure and MOVED THE SCANVIPS. I basically shuffled the services when I bounced everything. The first SCANVIP miraculously starts working. I can't get to the other 2. I jump on the node that owns the second SCANVIP and it's up. The listener is up and listening. For shits and giggles, I ping from the SCANVIP to the management system. No response. I ping the gateway. No response. I ask network.

&#x200B;

""ICMP is blocked by the layer 2 firewall."" And that's when it clicks. You see, the IP address moves, but the nodes' MAC address stays the same. So if I want to send a packet to SCANVIP number 1 on node 2, I look at my ARP table to see what MAC address is associated with that IP, and send a frame to that MAC. If the destination is on a different subnet, I send the frame to my router, and the packet makes its way to the router for that subnet. That router then uses its own ARP table to figure out where to send the frame.

&#x200B;

If the VIP moves, though, the ARP table contains stale information. Frames will go to the wrong node, where they will be discarded since the IP address isn't right. To fix this, HA systems will ping the gateway from the VIP to refresh the ARP table. Except the firewall blocks ICMP packets. SO the ping never goes through. And the ARP cache remains stale. After the cache TTL expires, the table gets the new MAC address, and now packets get sent to the VIP correctly.  


I tell network to enable ICMP. He can't without InfoSec approval. Which means that if we have a node failure, the DB will stop working until the ARP entries on the router expire. At least it's not production!  


  
TL;DR - In an effort to protect the database server from unauthorized access, InfoSec policies have ensured that failover will take much longer than it should."

If you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in /r/techsupport for further assistance.

 

**Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):**

* Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts.
* Consider enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts!
* Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.

 

**What is malware?**

[Malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. \[Source: Wikipedia.com\]

 

**How did I get infected?**

It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher’s website directly.

 

**How to prevent future infections:**

Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using [Ninite](http://ninite.com) for installing/updating software is very easy & safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.

techsupport,"Hello guys,

Here is my issue:

I have a laptop that I plug on my Samsung TV via HDMI and via a JBL soundbar. It worked fine a few weeks ago.

Yesterday, I tried again and it works on startup but each time I launch Netflix, the TV refreshes to adapt to the new stream (it always did that) but this time it stays black with only the sound. I have to exit Netflix, switch off the TV (or the sound bar) to force it to refresh again so that the image comes back.

&#x200B;

Here is what I tried:

\- Tried with some other application or game that usually causes my TV to refresh -> Same issue so it's not related to Netflix I guess

\- Tried updating to the latest Nvidia drivers -> Same issue

\- Tried plugging another computer (a desktop one) and I have no issue when the TV refreshes -> I guess the issue does not come from the TV

\- Windows 10 is up to date (latest update is from the 13/05) and I think I plugged the computer on the TV since then with no issues.

&#x200B;

Do you guys have an idea?

Thanks!

Long story short I have a few old hard drives lying around and I decided to plug a couple of them into my pc to see if they are still any good and if so what’s on them. I did all the usual stuff, shutdown the pc, unplugged the power cable and then I installed the first drive and bottled everything back up again. Aside from the drive making some worrying clicking noises it still showed on my pc and I was able to access it’s storage so I called that one good enough. I force shutdown my pc and unplugged it again before I removed the drive.

I installed the second drive and went to boot my system up again, and this time it said it was attempting data recovery and that it could take a few hours, I waited 3 and then I force shutdown the computer.

After removing the 2nd drive I wanted to test I went to boot up my pc with all of the originally functioning hardware and I am met with a loop of BSOD, restart, BSOD etc. The error message it shows is “Bad System Config Info” I removed every drive except for my M.2 with the OS with no luck, Ive also cleared my CMOS to reset my settings but It didn’t help either.

My next upgrade as recommended everywhere I to buy an SSD and replace my HDD or relegate it to a storage only device, so as I understand now, please correct me if I am wrong :
- Standard SSD (2.5"") are compatible with every computer having a SATA interface (please forgive me if my terminology is wrong),
- M.2 SSD (PCI-E or SATA) are compatible with PCI-E or SATA (depending on the model) and don't need a specific interface on the motherboard (it's just an evolution of standard SSD and HDD and can be installed on every motherboard) : they are so widely spread that I think it's the case.
- M.2 NVMe are the fastest thing out now but needs an MVMe interface to work (basically you need a modern motherboard)

As I am on a budget and return policy in my country is tricky, I need to choose the right type (M.2 ? I have a Gigabyte GA-Z87P-D3 motherboard with no sign of a M.2 interface and fastest PCI-E is 4x (16x running at 4x) so confusing).

So I recently got an ASUS TUF H310M-PLUS GAMING motherboard, and found that I'm unable to boot the computer with my two HyperX Fury 8 GB 2400MHz DDR4 CL16 RAM sticks loaded into the two slots available in the mobo.

I realize now that this may be an incompatibility issue, upon checking this QVL list ( https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/LGA1151/TUF_H310-PLUS_GAMING/TUF-H310-PLUS-GAMING_Memory-QVL-list.pdf ). My memory is not on there (HX424C15FB2/8), but similar versions of it are (such as HX424C15FB/16 which I presume is a single 16 GB stick).

In short, my PC boots with either stick in either slot, but not with both. I've checked, and both slots as well as both sticks are not faulty. Is there anything I could do (bios update maybe?) to make running both memory sticks viable, or do I just have to suck it up and get a single 16 GB stick?

techsupport,"I've had this Z87n for a while, worked well with 2x4GB of G.Skill Rip Jaws X F3-12800CL9D-8GBXL.

But the server was getting tight on RAM, so I bought a pair of 8GB of the same (but CL10): F3-12800CL10D-16GBXL.

When I put both sticks in, it refuses to start. When I put 1x4 and 1x8, it only sees 4GB total RAM in memtest86.

It's running the latest available bios (F6)

Did I get bad RAM, or is my system somehow incompatible with 16GB total RAM?"
techsupport,"I own a Samsung Galaxy S10+. Until recently it was fast charging just fine. I use either an Anker Wall Charger or an Aukey one.(both have 2 fast charging ports) I also use Anker powerline I and/or II. Recently however none of these seemed to be fast charging. I attempted a full restart of the phone, I unplugged and plugged in everything. I tried wireless charging, wired. (both had worked previously...) The phone would only regularly charge. However, I recently pulled out an original Samsung wall charger, with associated cable, and then, fast charging. So my question is...what do I have to do to get my $100+ worth of tech that HAD fast charged previously to fast charge again? to review: I've watched and looked at every video and googled a fairly deep rabit hole.

techsupport,Battery is dying and needs to be replaced but I don't want to tear my headphones apart only to find out I can't get them back together again.
techsupport,"This problem is very specific so sorry for the long description.

So I went out of town for a trip Tuesday and so I had someone update my CoD:Modern Warfare on that same day. I returned home on Friday night hoping to play the new update. A hour or so prior from starting my pc my dad had told me that our internet got disconnected Thursday and that they had someone come and fix it before I got home. So I hopped on my pc and everything booted up fine, the game launched fine, I found a match to play fine. The game ended and so I waited to join a another match when  it said I got disconnected from the servers. I thought that maybe it was just a small hiccup that happens regularly in gaming.

I started up the game again and I couldn’t even sit in the main menu for more than 30 secs until it said I got disconnected from the servers. 
^For conversation purposes we’ll call this incident : Event A. 

I tried launching it 2 more times and the same thing happened each time. At this point I thought it was my internet connection so I decided to try other games and see if it would disconnect me. I started up 4 different games, from 4 different multiplayer services all of which allowed me to launch perfectly and find a game perfectly and let me play multiple games back to back.
So I thought maybe I’m back to normal and started up CoD again and it went back to Event A
I restarted my pc twice and Event A happened each time. I restarted my router twice and Event A still happens. Keep in mind I would launch the game multiple times to see if it would work but same thing happened for an hour till one time it let me stay on the main menu for a few minutes. I thought at this point it’s gotta be back to normal right? Well turns out I was wrong.

It let me play exactly one game and once it ended and I was finding another game, it would disconnect me.
^ This will be mentioned as Event B

So for the past few days after this all started I would start up my pc and sometimes Event B would happen first, then Event A would happen for hours to the point where I just get off the game or my pc entirely. But wait there’s more! (sorry if this is long and boring)

 I would hit the jackpot and Event A would happen multiple times till Event B would happen but it wouldn’t disconnect me after that first game. It would let me play regularly, multiple games back to back to back, joining and leaving matches back to back, join friends from different regions of the world, the normal online gaming experience. 
^ This is Event C

The first time Event C happened it was 4am and I was genuinely tired so I hopped off after 3-4 games with my friends just to wake up the next day and Event A & B to happen and I would just play another game or hop off till later and try again multiple times. Fast forward to Sunday night and I guess I tried Event A & B so much that Event C happened again! I was so happy I played from like 6pm- 4am since I haven’t been able to play this one game for the past 2 1/2 days..... then all the sudden my GPU crashes, with no history of it ever crashing for the past 1 1/2 years that I’ve had it. So I restarted my pc and...you guessed it; Event A & B happens over and over again. 
I have only had Event C happen 3 times, 2 of which my GPU crashes. 

Now I have tried multiple solutions to try and fix it:
Reset router 
Reset pc
Uninstall and reinstall the game
Uninstall and reinstall the launcher
Unplug Ethernet cord from my pc and from the wall and from the router it self
Changed ports on router for Ethernet cord
Going into command prompt and using : ipconfig release ; ipconfig renew ; and ipconfig dnsflush

All of which still didn’t solve my problem. Now I don’t know if it’s because of my internet, my game or launcher files being corrupted, the game or launchers servers (unlikely since it seems no one else has this problem), or someone is ddosing me or I have a virus or what, I just need someone to please help me solve this problem because it’s the only game I can play with the friend so want to play with. So if there is any advice, tips, solutions, anything to help me please let me know!!

p.s. Some other occurrences would happen between Event A,B, and C that I didn’t think would help out but maybe to the right person it could, so please dm me if you would like to know."

techsupport,"If I understand correctly, getting a GPU on a headless machine to work for an RDP session, one needs a dummy plug. The GPU doesn't get involved, unless it thinks it has a monitor plugged in.

If so, and if one is using several monitors, are several dummy plugs needed?

Bonus:

Is there any control over which plug goes to which physical monitor, on the client side of the RDP connection? Different plugs have different resolutions. If there is one 4K monitor and one 4k plug, I suspect the idea is to see what happens and move cables around. Changing which screen is oriented where won't do it, I imagine.

Is it necessary to connect to a console session for the GPU and dummy plug(s) to kick in?"
techsupport,"I just built a new PC a few weeks ago, and experienced intermittent crashing (about once a week while gaming). I figured it was due to my overclock settings, so I dropped everything back down to stock, even disabled XMP, and it happened again. It never gave me a BSOD or any explanation. The PC would just restart in the middle of whatever I was doing, and then continue as if nothing had happened. So I decided to dig deeper and find out what was causing the restarts.

Being a brand new PC, my immediate suspicion was some sort of hardware failure. So I spent a full 24 hours running Memtest86 with no errors. Chkdsk and sfc didn't turn up anything either. Then, when I tried running driver verifier, I finally got it to give me a BSOD, but I couldn't figure out which driver it was from the dump file. I disabled all startup programs and used msconfig to disable all non-microsoft services, and brought them back one by one while running driver verifier until I got another BSOD. 

It turned out to be Logitech G Hub that was the culprit all along. I ended up having to use Revo Uninstaller to get rid of it, because the regular control panel uninstaller couldn't even get rid of this malware. So now I am planning to return my logitech mouse and keyboard since the g keys are useless without the software. Just figured I'd post this up in case anyone else is experiencing similar issues and might find it helpful. 

tl;dr: G Hub bad."

Those who create infections have been stockpiling XP vulnerabilities for months because if they wait for MS to drop support then they can use them forever, versus infecting machines now with these tricks and Microsoft patching XP to prevent those tricks from working in the future.

Also XP was released in 2001, and has well run it's course, now with 3 consumer operating systems from Microsoft having been released.

New hardware won't support XP, and neither will new software (Office 2013 for example won't run on XP *or* Vista). When Microsoft stops supporting XP, it will be a very short time before everyone else stops as well.

* * *

**What if I use ""X"" software to protect me from infections**

There are a lot of good protection softwares out there. One of the most popular amongst this community is Microsoft Security Essentials, which will also cease working on April 1st, 2014 (for XP machines).

Even if you have great protection software, it's still something that is added on TOP of your operating system, and if there are holes in your OS, infections will still be able to get in. 3rd party companies aren't going to be able to patch all the security issues in XP, and they'll only support XP for as long as there is a market. And it should be noted that XP's market share has been dropping fast and will continue to do so. Don't be one of the stragglers still hanging on past April 1st.

* * *

**Where to go**

Windows Vista, 7, 8, Linux, etc. are all available as upgrade paths. I personally would recommend Windows 7, as it has a good upgrade path from XP and currently has the largest market share of any Operating System. Meaning, much like XP, it will likely have a very long line of support. I figure if you stuck with XP for this long, you'll probably want something you can also stick with for as long as you can.

Other options exist and if you're interested you can discuss them in the comments below. I'll keep some links here for quick access

**How to back up data:**

When upgrading to a new Operating System, it's always best to do a fresh install, so any little bugs don't carry over. This means everything will be wiped clean, so you should back up all the data on your computer that you want to keep. Even if you do an OS Upgrade, there's still a chance your data could be lost (about 1 in 10 from the hundreds I've done for regular household computers). And you should be backing up your data regularly anyways.

The easiest route will likely be to get an external hard drive, copy everything you want to keep over to it, and then unplug the external drive before wiping your computer and installing the new OS.

For more information on data backup see our wiki page:

* [**WIKI:** Different ways of backing up data and keeping it safe:](http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/wiki/hdd#wiki_different_ways_of_backing_up_data_and_keeping_it_safe.3A)

**Compatibility and the difference between 32-Bit and 64-Bit**

If you use older software, it may not be compatible with newer operating systems. This is always the case. Fortunately the vast majority of software that worked on XP will also work on Vista/7/8. So you shouldn't have much to worry about, but if you have any truly ancient software, now is the time to find a replacement.

Something many people are confused about when transitioning from XP to a newer operating system is the difference between 32 and 64-bit. So I'm going to clear it up so you'll understand what is best for you.

* **32-Bit:** This is what computers used for the longest time. Back in the 80's when computers were considered powerful if they had 4 MB of RAM (roughly the size of one MP3), they started using 32-Bit systems. They knew that it would work great for a long time, because it had a max of 4 GB (or 4,096 MB). And it did last for a long time. But we got to a point where we were producing 4GB sticks of RAM relatively cheap and needed to change to something that could see all of the RAM and be able to use it.
* **64-Bit:** This is what we gradually transitioned to from around 2004 to now. It can see below 4GB, just like 32-bit, and above to virtually any RAM amount that will exist in your lifetime (17,592,186,044,416 MB). To put that number in perspective, if each one of those MBs was equal to one second, then that would be roughly 35,000 years. 35,000 years ago was when neanderthals went extinct. So, it's a pretty big number. Which is why we're switching all our computers over to it. The only downside is that since it **is** so different, some programs won't work with it that would work on a 32-bit machine. Again, these are mostly programs from the 1990's, and before, but some newer ones may have issues too. But since we've been doing this 64-Bit thing for about a decade now, you're not as likely to run in to too many issues. So unless you absolutely have to use a program made for Windows 95, and refuse to find a replacement, you should go with 64-Bit to take advantage of having access to more RAM.

If you have questions regarding upgrading from XP to another OS that still has support, ask them below. This post will be pinned so the community will be here to help those making the switch.

**TLDR:** XP is getting dropped by Microsoft meaning infections will run rampant on it. Back up your data and upgrade to Windows 7, or something else with long term support. Ask for help with the switch in the comments below."
24hoursupport,"I was trying to download a streaming movie/tv service (not netflix) and I got hijacked by something called Delta Search. When it kicked in, it replaced Chrome as the default browser.  After several hours of struggle, I thought I got rid of it and got Chrome back as default, but I found that I couldn't sign in to google and had to replace my password.

Next I try to log into reddit, and it tells me that there is no account  with my 3-year username, and that it is available for registration.  So I registered under piranha-pool again. I'm not worried about lost Karma, but I really am pissed at the loss of my account, and the fact that I lost my three year award attached to it and appear to be a new user.

Has anyone else experienced Delta Search?  How did you get rid of it, and how did it affect your internet experience?

I have **resolved** this issue on my own, and it appears to be spreading, so I am posting here to alert those of you who may run into the same problem. I will attempt to use terms that make it searchable. I hope this helps someone avoid going for the nuclear option, i.e. reformat+reinstall or reimage.

I am running Windows 7 x64 SP1. Your KB number may be different on Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.

(edit) This has been noted to affect 64-bit systems on the Microsoft forums. It's entirely possible that this is one of the factors that decides which systems bluescreen, and which ones don't.

After installing the update, originally pushed in August 2014, the system crashes with a blue screen during the boot process. The logo throbber shows up and then it dies. The BSOD shows STOP error 50 (00000050), **PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA** in Win32k.sys. You can't even boot into Safe Mode, because it dies right after **CLASSPNP.SYS** loads when you do. Chkdsk shows nothing wrong. Sfc will show nothing wrong.

Higher level diagnostic info in this paragraph: Loading it into Windbg, it resolves down to loading a font in Win32k.sys. This corresponds exactly to a change made in the [patch description](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2982791) which upon boot throws bugcheck 50. Rolling back the update resolves the issue. Fortunately you can do this manually and leave it in a state where you can boot and clean up the residual Windows Update data if you have old versions of the two files.

The first thing the average user should try is to boot with the Windows media and do a System Restore (NOT reinstall or reformat or a vendor's system recovery!) back to the checkpoint before you installed the update. If it doesn't have the date and time on it, don't click it. If for some reason you disabled that or want to DIY, continue on.

edit: Another solution has been making the rounds on various forums. I don't know who to credit since I can't find a first post, but I did not invent this line: Try to delete C:\Windows\System32\FNTCACHE.DAT.

1. You will need the Win32k.sys and Gdi32.dll files from the System32 directory on a system that has not received the patch. This source system must also have the same bit width, ie. 32-bit or 64-bit, and it should be at the same service pack level. **I cannot send you these files.**

2. Use [Hiren's Boot CD](http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/) or similar boot disc to boot, OR take the drive out of the system and plug it into another system as a secondary drive. I used HBCD and was fortunate enough to have a second drive with a pre-update Windows installation.

3. Back up the Win32k.sys and Gdi32.dll files from the affected Windows installation. It doesn't matter where, and they are small.

4. Overwrite the affected installation's Win32k.sys and Gdi32.dll files from your copy taken from the other working installation.

5. Boot the now-operational system.

6. Uninstall the KB update via the Programs and Features control panel, View Installed Updates sidebar link, so it isn't left in an indeterminate state. This will require a reboot. Your system will boot normally.

Automatic Updates may cause this patch to be installed without prompting or intervention. So you might want to go into Windows Update control panel, check for updates, and specifically hide this update for now.

Android,"I know the title is rather sensational, however it couldn't get any closer to the truth.

For those who are too busy to read the whole post, here's the TL;DR version: **The   storage scanner in the Device Care section is made by a super shady   Chinese data-mining/antivirus company called Qihoo 360. It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).

This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r/samsung](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/) and [r/galaxys10](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.

For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.

If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line ""powered by 360"". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo\_360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo_360)).

If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998](https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.

With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \[dot\] cn, wshifen \[dot\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https://imgur.com/EtfInqv](https://imgur.com/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.

Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their ""Big Data   platform"", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).

I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.

After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.

Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?

This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the ""nothing to hide"" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.

**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  
To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them."
Android,"A notable amount of people already bought new phones just because they wanted to get to play Pokémon GO, so that's something.

But the thing is: that shit requires a good battery. My 3 year old S4 drains its self empty really quickly if I keep the game open while walking, and I know that's an issue with newer phones aswell. The big difference between Pokémon and other mobile games is that you'll play the game in places with no way to recharge your phone, and you often play for extended durations at once (instead of just log in, 2 min taptaptap, turn off).

Now in theory, if someone plays that game and is going to buy a new phone, it's more likely that they'll add ""need a really good battery"" on their list of ""features I want""... and as such, in the long run, phones with great batteries will sell more.

Which will, hopefully, lead to companies spending more time developing battery technologies since it's now a bigger selling point than before.

Or maybe they'll just start marketing portable chargers for Pokémon players and nothing else happens because the players will already have their extra battery with that, and they don't need a better phone battery anymore.

I don't really know what I'm talking about, just a showerthought.

TL;DR Pokémon drains battery. Players will buy more phones that have good battery. Companies start focusing more on battery power."
Android,"There is an upcoming change to the YouTube ToS that states that:

>YouTube may terminate your access, or your **Google account’s** access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.

While this wording is (probably intentionally) vague, it could mean bad things for anyone using ad block, YT Vanced, etc if Google decides that you're not ""commercially viable"". I know that personally, I would be *screwed* if I lost my Google account.

If you think this is not worth worrying about, look at what Google has just done to hundreds of people that were using (apparently) too many emotes in a YT live stream chat that Markiplier just did. They've banned/closed people's entire Google accounts and are denying appeals, and it's hurting people in very real ways. Here is [Markiplier's tweet/vid](https://twitter.com/markiplier/status/1193015864364126208) about it for more info.

It's pretty scary the direction Google is going, and I think we should all reevaluate how much we rely on their services. They could pull the rug out from under you and leave you with no recourse, so it's definitely something to be aware of.

EDIT: I see the mods have tagged this ""misleading"", and I'm not sure why. Not my intention, just trying to give people the heads up that the ToS are changing and it *could* be bad. The fact that the verbiage is so vague, combined with Google/YouTube's past actions - it's worth being aware of and best to err on the side of caution IMO. I'm not trying to take risks with my Google account that I've been using for over a decade, and I doubt others want to either. Sorry if that's ""misleading""."
Android,"Let's say the speculation ends up being true and the 2021 iPhone will have no ports. Now, I couldn't care less about what features the iPhone has or doesn't have. I use an Android phone. What I do care about, is that Android phone manufacturers have a bit of a reputation for blindly copying Apple in hopes that making the same mistakes as Apple will make them successful. But I digress.

When you think about it, this situation seems eerily similar to the headphone jack going extinct: Apple realized, that they could make a lot more money by selling expensive Bluetooth earbuds, rather than cheap wired ones, so they removed the headphone jack. And soon, nearly every other manufacturer followed suit.

What I'm afraid of, is that the same thing will happen all over again; Apple removes the charging port, creates an expensive, proprietary wireless charger, and others follow along a couple years later.

Now, you could argue that removing the charging port is just so utterly ridiculous, that no other manufacturer would be insane enough to remove it. But, isn't that exactly what we said about the headphone jack?

My point is, that if Apple does end up removing the charging port, we have to make it damn clear to our favorite phone manufacturers, that we won't let them get away with it. Otherwise, there is a high chance history will repeat itself."

I had it in my back pocket before taking it out to take a picture, but it froze and shut down. After trying and failing to turn it back on for a minute or so, I put it down on my countertop and figured I'll just try again later. Literally no more than a couple seconds after putting it down the whole thing spontaneously went up in flames. I had a couple nearby towels catch fire too, thought my kitchen was gonna burn down for a moment.

I took the phone to Samsung's local customer service this morning and was told nothing can be done since I bought it two years ago and it's no longer under warranty. I'm glad I'm safe and all I lost was the phone considering how close I came to getting severe burns, but I'm pretty bummed. This was an expensive phone that I expected to last me longer, and certainly didn't expect to almost start a fire at my place. 

I contacted them on twitter, but I don't really expect anything considering how bad customer service is in Morocco. I loved my S7E and my previous Galaxy phones, but I think I'm kinda done with Samsung after this.

e: a word

Edit: Samsung support USA got in touch on twitter and requested some info. I'm not sure what can be done considering where I am, but I'm glad someone at least reached out. I'll update if there's any news.

Edit 2: I got a call at work from Samsung Morocco this morning. They apologized and said the issue should have been better handled by the store, and that they'll be back in touch later today. I went back to the store to see if they'd salvaged my microSD and sim card (tray slot is stuck) and was told they also got a call about the issue and the device will likely be sent in for investigation.

Edit 3: Hi guys. I got another call asking me to drop by the store to sign some paperwork and pick up an S9. The lady over the phone sounded genuinely apologetic about the whole incident, I was relieved and thought you know what, it took some pressure, but they came through and maybe we can start mending this relationship. I get to the store and I'm presented with a document to sign that requires me to delete all social media posts about this without delay and cease all further comments. This is doubly disappointing. My conscience isn't worth $900, so I guess this is it. Thanks everyone who helped me get my issue heard.

Android,"A year ago, almost to the day, I compiled a post of all the resources that would be required for a complete programming noob to set out making an Android app. At the time the post was one of the highest on r/Android of all time. This year, having vastly improved my own skills, I’m out to make the ultimate guide to creating Android apps without prior experience.
 
[Here is a link to the old post, in case you’re interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1w3woc/a_step_by_step_guide_about_how_to_get_started_and/)
 
##There are two ways of approaching this post:

1.      Be at a computer, follow the explanations and instructions and you’ll have an app and some basic skills to branch off by the end of it.
2.      Just read the post and learn some basic app skills.
 
**What is Java?**
 
Java is a programming language like C++, Python and Ruby. Essentially, most apps on the Android platform (most games and other apps are written in different languages) are written in Java. Approaching a programming language without prior experience is challenging, but with a little patience it is doable. 
 
**Java is an OOP or Objected Oriented-Programming Language**
 
This means that Java is a programming language based on the concept of objects, which are essentially fields of data that can run code and store variables.
For example, a String object is an object that contains any combination of letters, numbers and other characters. A String is formatted in quotation marks, here is an example use:
 
    String name = ""Dennis"";
 
    String surname = ""Cometti"";
 
    String FullName = name + "" "" + surname;
 
 
After this runs, the variable FullName will equal “Dennis Cometti”.  A String is an example of a basic object, other basic Objects in Java include Integers (any whole number), booleans (a true or false value) and floating points (decimal values like 3.0).
 
I HIGHLY recommend checking out [this website for a more detailed explanation.](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/java-tutorial--mobile-2604)

Objects can also contain other objects and variables, for example you could define a ‘Quote’ Object that contains two values: The actual quote and the name of the quoted person.
 
**A lot of the fundamentals in Java are essentially plain English**
 
All of Java is written in English, the structure of the words change but if enough attention is given to it can actually be very easy to understand. For example:
 
    String name = ""DENNIS"";
 
    name = name.toLowerCase();
 
 
It couldn’t be any clearer, this will assign the lower case converted “DENNIS” (""dennis"") to the 'name' variable.
After you have typed ‘name.’ Android Studio will give you a list of possible methods (like toLowerCase() or toUpperCase()) that can be used, so you get some guidance.
 
**Classes, methods and objects in Java**
 
•     A **variable** holds a field of data. A variable might be a surname, your weight or the distance travelled by your car. A String is a variable that could contain “Dennis” and an int is a variable that could contain the number 89.
 
•     A **method** is a function (like name.toLowerCase()). Basically a method does things using variables or any number of lines of code. You can write your own methods, for example in the app we will be making soon we will be making a method called getQuote(). A method might display a quote on a screen or change the text in a TextView.
 
•     An **object** holds both variables and methods; one object might be the details of your car, a second object might represent my car.
 
•     A **class** is a template that holds variables, methods and other objects.
 
**So what is the difference between classes and objects?**
 
A class would be a Car (containing no details but rather a template).
An object would be your Car (containing all the details about the car).
 
A class would be a String (containing no details but rather a template).
An object would be a ‘name’ (containing the String “Dennis”).
 
If you are confused, don’t worry, once you have followed the instructions you’ll understand it much clearer.

##How do you get started making an app? 
 
**Get Android Studio**

Android Studio is the new (just out of beta) Android Integrated Development Environment, don’t let the words confuse you – it’s essentially a program that has all the tools you need to make an app. Some people come across some issues installing Android Studio make sure you are Googling any issues that you come across in this stage, but you should be fine.  You’ll come across many things you don’t understand when making apps but I guarantee you 1000 people have had the same problem before and there will be help or tutorials online (you shouldn’t need them for this exercise).
 
#Instruction #1: [Download and install the Java JDK]( http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)

#Instruction #2: [Download and install Android Studio, but don’t open it yet.]( https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
 
**Strings in Android**

Strings as mentioned earlier, are used everywhere: App Dialogs, Titles, Messages, Error Logs and literally wherever you see characters. The problem is, when you are making an app with many Strings it can become quite fiddly. So Google created a solution: a single file that stores all of your Strings in one place, so you can get that one file translated and refer to those strings in tons of different parts of the code.
[Here’s a link from Google that can explain it in more detail]( http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html)
 
**How Android Studio works**

Android Studio contains all the tools you need to make an app: for this tutorial you won’t be using many. When you create a new ‘Project’ (App) Android Studio will generate all the files and folders necessary to begin a project.
[This screenshot shows what it generates](http://i.imgur.com/HOX9B7S.png)
This looks quite complex but it’s actually quite simple. For example the ‘layout’ folder will contain all the layouts of the app screens you’ll use, which brings us to the next few steps.
 
 
 
 
 
#####We are going to make a simple Quote app! It will show a quote plus the name of the person who made the quote and loop through as many quotes as you like when you tap the screen.

>

 
#Instruction #3: Open Android Studio and click the create new project button.

 
#Instruction #4: [Follow these screenshots exactly to set up the new project]( http://imgur.com/a/o7NdR)

 
#Instruction #5: [You should land on this page, if not, open the layouts folder and click the file inside it](http://imgur.com/JM4BIMV.png)

 
#Instruction #6:
The screen you are on now is the layout screen, if you click the design button towards the bottom you will be greeted with a drag and drop editor. For now replace all of the text in the text tab with this: http://pastebin.com/pRisAsPF

This has formatted the layout of the main app Activity, but you can change some things around. Try changing the text from “Tap the screen to begin” to something else. Extra points to anyone who can change the font color.
 
#Instruction #7:
Now we have to make a new class, and the quote Object we spoke about earlier. These screenshots show how to make a new class: http://imgur.com/a/3I7v9

You’ll now land on the empty Quote class, but we are going to fill it with a bit of code now.
You will see ‘public class Quote{}’, in between these two squiggly brackets paste this code: http://pastebin.com/VhHbWwSN 
Just click OK to any popup boxes.

What this class does is allows the app to create a Quote object that we can use, you ‘instantiate’ the class and pass through a quote and name (where it says public Quote(String mQuote, String mPerson)) and then you can retrieve the quote or person name later. More on this soon.
 
#Instruction #8:
Click on the Quotebook class here: http://i.imgur.com/bG2d0VD.png
Then copy and paste this code in between the onCreate(){ brackets but after all of the other code inside: http://pastebin.com/wz8gbWWA

You’ll notice some red squiggly lines telling you there is an error, so just under the line that says public class Quotebook extends Activity {  add in this variable/line: int count = 0;

This is what the two sections should look like after the have been copied and pasted: http://pastebin.com/3FXi14XZ
 
 
 
 
 
#Explanation time!
 
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_quotebook);
 
    RelativeLayout touch = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.touch);
    final TextView quoteText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.quote);
    final TextView personText = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.person);
 
 
The first line sets the app page (Activity) to be the layout we created earlier. The following lines just declare the Textboxes on the layout we created so we can change the text in them.

____________________


     final ArrayList<Quote> quoteList = new ArrayList<Quote>();
 
     Quote quote1 = new Quote(""You're more of a fun vampire. You don't suck blood, you just suck."", ""Troy Barnes"");
     quoteList.add(quote1);
 
     Quote quote2 = new Quote(""Cool Beans"", ""Rod Kimble"");
     quoteList.add(quote2);
 
 
The first line here creates an Array/List that we can add as many quotes as we like to, note how the List is called ‘quoteList’.
 
The next 4 lines are where the Quote class we created earlier are coming in to play. What we are doing here is passing a quote and a person’s name (separated by a comma) through to the Quote class and it becomes a variable, we then add that Variable to the quoteList.

____________________


This is where it gets a little tricky:
 
    touch.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
 
                if (count < quoteList.size()) {
 
                   Quote q = quoteList.get(count);
                   quoteText.setText(q.getQuote());
                   personText.setText(q.getPerson());
 
                   count = count + 1;
 
                } else{
 
                    count = 0;
 
           }}});
 
 
This looks complex but if you imagine it as a plain English sentence it makes far more sense.

*If every quote has been cycled through, set the count to 0 so it starts again.
If we have not gone through every quote, get the Quote variable in the quoteList at the count we are up to, then set the text on the quote and person textboxes to the quote data we just grabbed*

If you read through the code and the English algorithm above a few times you should be able to understand what this code is doing.
 
 
 
#Instruction #9:
Find the two folders on the left hand side labelled ‘values’ and ‘values-v21’, they should both contain a file called styles.xml
In the ‘values’ folder, change the parent= value to be:

    parent=""android:Theme.Holo.NoActionBar""
 
In the ‘values-v21’ folder, change the parent= value to be:

    parent=""android:Theme.Material.NoActionBar""
 
This just changes the App Theme, you could every try change to other themes.
 
#Instruction #10:
To do this next step, you have to:
- Ensure that you have your phones USB drivers properly installed.
 
- [Enable Developer Settings](http://www.greenbot.com/article/2457986/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.html) then enable USB Debugging.
 
- Have your phone plugged in and accept the popup that checks if you would like to connect to your computer (Android Studio/ADB)
 
Then, you have to click the [green play button](http://i.imgur.com/cOkY2Ep.png), the app will compile and if you have set it up correctly it should send it to your phone and open the app!
 
If you have issues here, Google your phone + abd drivers/android studio.
 
#Instruction #11:

Change the quotes around, try and add more! If you have a particular interest in an area change the quotes and make a targeted app like a movie quotes app that has all your favourite quotes or lines.
 
Change the font, colours, formatting or use.
Share your own versions in the comments!
 
#If you enjoyed that, here are all the resources you need to dive deeper in to Android Development.
 
**Libraries**
 
Libraries are like pre-made bundles of code that you can use instead of coding everything yourself.
For example the IO Commons library  contains a huge range of methods that manipulate files in one line, like copyFile(), moveFile() and getExtension() instead of having to do them manually.
There are specifically made Android libraries from Google that allow you to use newer Android features like the navigation drawer on older devices.
 
Android Arsenal is a great site for finding Android Libraries:
https://android-arsenal.com/
 
And here is how to add them to Android Studio:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16588064/how-do-i-add-a-library-project-to-the-android-studio
 
 
**More advanced Pro-Tips**
 
- Stack Overflow is a fantastic community if you have any development questions - but Google it first.
- Check out /r/androiddev
- Follow Google Design Guidelines.
- If you don't really understand some code or how to do a particular task, Google it, comment what you are trying to do and ask around.
- Use libraries wherever you can.

Android,Forcing me to mobile versions of YouTube/imgur is unacceptable.  This app feels thrown together by a child.
Android,"Many of us are frustrated at the release of Allo and it got me thinking, I'm tired of Google. Their philosophy of throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks is infuriating. They kill apps that could be great (Google Wallet), or they just don't put 100% of their effort into them and then act confused on why they fail. Allo needed one thing to be successful and Google **STILL** didn't listen. 

The Pixel phones seem to be focused on the average consumer, but they can't even make a messaging app that the average consumer wants to use in the first place. The rumored price point seems incredibly high for what the phones appear to offer and they can't even update their phones on time which brings me to my next point.

Google can't update their own phones reliably. Android N had months of beta testing and the rollout was still a trainwreck. Nexus 6 owners are  angry and there are still massive battery-draining bugs in the final release. It takes the Android  update system thats already in a poor state and makes it look even worse. Sure iOS10 had a bumpy start as well, but Apple has been fixing the issues consistently. Meanwhile Google is radio silent about the whole issue and has yet to fix any of the bugs that has plagued Android for years. 

Finally, Google has appeared to completely have forgotten about Material Design. It's one the best looking design languages but they don't even follow their own damn guidelines 50% of the time. Look at the new Pixel Launcher. It looks convoluted and doesn't appear to match any other design Google has. Youtube seems to change its design every week so I'm not even sure what they are trying to accomplish. Then there's the Play icons (Doritos) that don't even come close to matching MD. I know it's just ""guidelines"" but the idea was to unify a design language on Android so that things were familiar from app to app, and that's just not the case. 

I love Android, I really do but I'm just frustrated by Google's choices and they don't seem to have a clear vision of what they want Android to be.  Apple actually knows the direction they want to take iOS, while providing amazing support to all of their devices. They makes dumb decisions also dont get me wrong, but I feel like they have less drawbacks than what Google is doing currently with Android right now. /rant 


(Edit: Thanks for the gold strangers! Also love the flair the mods gave this post haha)"
Android,"EDIT: Here's a better example: https://streamable.com/l6hvq

I know I don't scroll 100% vertically but I don't think anybody does. Doing the same in other apps does not result in 'ghost swipes' like this. Also, notice how the last ""undo"" button disappears really quickly.

We all know that the google Play Music Android app is not very aesthetically pleasing or very user friendly but you can get used to these things and I have done so over the past 3 years.

However, there is one thing that is now making the app even more annoying: You can swipe songs to delete them from playlists - at it is very easy to do so without trying.

I can't remember how long this has been going on but I can say that I've deleted a bunch of songs from playlists without know which song it was. And exactly this happened right before I decided to record this video. The 'undo' button disappears as soon as you touch anywhere else on the screen so when you're quickly scrolling through a playlist this happens very often.

Here's an example of how you can scroll quickly through the playlist you've created and accidentally delete songs:

https://streamable.com/wz9h9

I compare it with another app, 'Relay for reddit', where you can also swipe left or right on tiles to do an action. 
In Relay you don't get accidental swipes left or right like you do in the Google Play Music app. How hard is it to fix this, Google?

Edit: I know the video isn't the best example but I was being a little cautious since I didn't actually want to delete any songs because it's a hassle to find them again sometimes.

And while I'm adding to the post I want to let you know that I just deleted a song because I wanted to scroll all the way down to the bottom of one of my playlists 😢"
Android,"I remember being super mind-blown by NFC tags when I got my galaxy S3 many years ago. I thought, ""This is going to be the future! Everything is going to use NFC!"". Years later, it's still very rarely actually used in the real world aside from payments. I was thinking to myself, ""Why dont routers come with NFC stickers for pairing your devices? Why don't car phone mounts come with NFC for connecting your phone to your car stereo? Why doesn't everything use NFC to connect to everything else?"" 

One of my favorite features was the ability to easily Bluetooth pair things. No more ""what's the device name?"" ""Why isn't it showing up yet?"" ""What's the connection pin?"" Just.. *touch* and you're done

Then I realized because if manufactures started pushing NFC, only android users would be able to take advantage of it. Even tho iPhones have NFC chips, they have them restricted to payments only. It's really frusterating to me, our phones already have the chips, it already only costs cents to make the tags, yet the technology goes mostly unused

EDIT: I know iPhones can pay with NFC. That's not the point. I'm saying they should be able to do more then just payments."
Android,"The app lacks some very basic features and also needs a better way to find Live Broadcasts.

Edit: Sounds like a LOT of you are discontented with the app, and not just me."
Android,"I currently am using a Galaxy S10+ but to be frank, I still haven't used my headphone jack since I got this phone. Kinda curious how many of you guys still use it on the daily?"
Applehelp,"EDIT: Going to bed now (hopefully I can sleep). I've made the general layout. Great ideas so far!

As someone pointed out, the link on the sidebar for new users is 3 years old and I felt this would be a better way to update/fix it. Please bare with me as I don't own all Apple products (for example, Android phone and tablets). If I've missed anything, please let me know (it's 5am where I am and I've had zero sleep).

I'll add in resources (guides, how-to's) and Q&As as they start rolling in.

**IOS Products** | iPod, iPhone, iPad

Applehelp,"I keep seeing people complaining about their lost data and how upset they are. I can’t feel bad because you had OPTIONS! I’m surprised at how many people have this issue and then complain about it or blame on Apple! It’s your responsibility! Apple has made it extremely easy to do a backup on iCloud and for cheap too. In perspective you could spend the equal amount of two drinks from Starbucks yearly to just have your data saved up automatically and the fact that people don’t wanna pay that is baffling to me. And if you don’t wanna pay fine, you can use iTunes, an external hard drive, Google Photos, 3rd party apps, there are so many options and yet people just wait until it’s too late. Do your own research, do your homework, it’s your data, not anyone else’s responsibility. They want someone to fix it for them when it could have been prevented. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do a backup!"
Applehelp,"Hey all. Like I said in the title, I just ordered the new iPhone SE, and I’m very excited to finally join the rest of the world in having a modern device. The closest thing I have is an old iPod touch which has been cool, but not really on par with where everyone else is at.   

I plan on taking very good care of this device and having it for a while, so I’d like to get some decent accessories to go along with it.   

I’m wondering about the quality of the leather cases. They seem kind of fancy which I appreciate, but I don’t know how they’d deal with drops. I like the style of a leather case, but am considering some military grade case for safety. Can I collect some opinions here? Also, this new SE is the size of an iPhone 8, right? So if I were to look for cases, I could look for ones that fit the 8, to maybe not get price gouged?   

Second question - The phone has fast charging, but it doesn’t come with a cable that DOES fast charging. From what I’ve read it seem the phone comes with something that 5w, and I can purchase a charger that’s 18w for the fast charge. Is this correct? Is there anything I should know regarding the 18w fast chargers. I think the ones on amazon say usb c, and I don’t know what that means. Would that be the one to get?   

Third, it says the phone also has something called wireless charging. I don’t really know what this is but I hate wires, so I’m probably gonna get one. I’ve seen things that look like little circular pads that you simply place your phone on and it charges, and I’ve seen others that look like the phone is docked, which I have no interest in. What do you guys think of the one that you simply lay the phone on? Is it helpful? Does it work well? Any other thoughts or recommendations?

Applehelp,Just wanted to show my appreciation to all the people who try and answer the questions that we have as a community. Fixing technical issues based on your responses is such a relief to someone like myself so entrenched and dependent on Apple technology. Thank you!
Applehelp,"After reading the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/15cq45/i_guess_ill_be_that_guy/) on /r/apple about how little help there is on this sub, I'm going to try and use my background to help people out. First, I'll cover some basics that I picked up over the years.

###About me

I worked at Apple as a ""Genius"" for several years in the early 2000's and now am part owner in my own Apple Consulting firm. 

###Software Problems

##Finding the cause, not the fix

Most of the work I did at Apple and do at my current job when confronted with a problem was not trying to fix the issue. The real helpful part is finding where the issue is.

OS X has an easy time rebuilding files that it needs. More often than not, removing the problem files will result in the OS automatically re-creating a fresh copy of the file without any issues. Finding these files is not too hard. Just narrow it down. As always, do a backup of everything incase you accidentally delete something that was more necessary than you might have thought. 

##User or System

Almost all software issues fall into problems with files within the User or System folder. A very quick and easy thing to try is to create a new user and see if the same issue you're having is happening there. 

If it does, you're dealing with an issue with something in the Application or System folders. Try re-installing the App or the [OS](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH3878?viewlocale=en_US). (Please backup first!)

##Libraries or Library

If your issue doesn't happen in the new user, you're problem is in your User folder. 

A few apps, like iTunes and iPhoto have Libraries that might prevent the app from opening. In either of those apps, press and hold down option when opening the app. This will allow you to create a new blank library. If that blank library doesn't seem to have the same issue as the main one, your problem is probably there. (Press and hold option again and choose your old library.)

All apps create a file on your Mac that keep track of how you like things setup. (Window size, customized settings, etc...) It isn't uncommon for this Preference file to get messed up to the point of causing issues with the App. To find it, open the Library. Open the Preferences folder and find the App in question. (It will be named in the following way: com.company.app, for instance, com.apple.iTunes) Move that file to the desktop (backup!) and remove it from the Preference folder. Open the app and see if it works. If not, but the backup file back. 

###Hardware Problems

Similar to the user/system steps with software issues, you can narrow the hardware issue down by trying to recreate the same issue with slightly different equipment.


##Hard Drive

An external drive with a copy of OS X installed has helped me more than anything else. If your computer is acting slow, not booting or a myriad of other issues, a drive like this can help you fix or recover your data with much less effort. 

##Safe Boot/Mode

Turn on your Mac and immediately hold down the shift key. Let go when you see the spinning gear or the progress bar appear below the Apple logo. This will scan your Mac for file system issues (and try to fix them). It will allow boot your computer with a lot of things can could cause problems disabled. (DVD Player, capture video, audio input/output devices, USB modem, WiFi...) If your Mac isn't booting, this can help you backup files before doing a reinstall. Reboot the Mac to get out of safe mode. 

##Other hardware

Some of these things might seem obvious, but worth mentioning.

Video looks distorted? Try an external monitor/TV. Or take a screen shot. If the other device or screen shot is distorted, you've got a video card issue. 

Sound not working? Try headphones or speakers. Also, look into the headphone jack. If you see a red light, the Mac thinks an optical audio connector is plugged in. This might be able to be fixed with a quick blast of compressed air or it might require a repair. 

###If it seems like you've tried everything, these couldn't hurt:###

I see these listed on the right, but I'll list them here anyway (Since I typed it out before seeing it.) These might not be for your exact issue, but it's worth a shot. 

##PMU reset##

This is a quick reset to a small component of your Mac that hold small amounts of data. Resetting this can help with more random issues than I can list here. This won't hurt anything, but will reset little settings like volume level. 

Restart your Mac. Press and hold the following keys: command, option, p, r.

Keep them held down until you hear the Mac startup sound once or twice. Let go and let it boot up. 

##SMC reset##

Another random step to try is to reset the SMC. Again, it won't hurt anything. I had a lot of people bring in their broken"" Macs just to have it work when they get here because of this.

Shut down your Mac then follow the next steps for what kind of computer you have.

#Desktops: Unplug the power cable. Wait 15 seconds. Plug it back in. Wait 5 seconds before pressing power to boot. 
#Laptops with removable batteries: Unplug from power cable. Take out battery. Press and hold power button for 5 seconds. Reconnect battery and boot normally.
#Laptops without removable batteries: Plug in the power cable. Press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time. Let go of all the keys at the same time. Boot normally.

(I'm going to add more and fix formatting on this later, but have to get ready for Christmas eve festivities. More to come...)"
Applehelp,"I ordered a new pair of AirPod Pros but couldn't get them to pass the fit test (unlike my wife's pair that fits perfectly). After a few days I decided to return them (hoping to simply exchange for another pair hoping they'd fit), so I packaged them up and dropped off at the FedEx store on Thu 4/23.

I was a little ancy as I only had my backup pair of old AirPods (which barely work), so I kept checking FedEx's tracking and noticed that my package wasn't picked up at the store for another 4 days, Mon 4/27. I should also note that unlike 99.9% of the time when I return something via FedEx or UPS, you can track each stop... but this order never did that. It finally showed delivered on May 1 to Apple.

I've been in contact w/ Apple support via chat, email, and phone. **They're claiming I sent back an old pair of Earpods, not the Airpod Pros I purchased.** This is CRAZY. At first I thought the shipping delay was due to COVID-19, but now I'm worried that someone at the FedEx store may have tampered w/ package.

Apple is escalating and I just filed a claim w/ FedEx, but this is an absolute clusterfuck.

Any advice, suggestions???

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Apple is sending me a new pair... but the confusion seems to be that the FedEx tracking number somehow changed. Doesn't make sense to me, but I'm happy to get my stuff!"
Applehelp," I’ve heard and seen this Phishing attempt in action. This is a clever and coordinated attack that uses vulnerabilities and human error to commit. This can take place on an individual level or a highly public area. The last place I heard of this was at a concert in Las Vegas, many phones were pickpocketed and the scammers used this method to effectively steal the devices. TL:DR at the bottom.

As you might know, Activation Lock and Find my iPhone help locate missing devices and prevent usage erasing the iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch. The following steps highlight the scam:

In the event of a stolen device:

1. I will want to access Find my iPhone and put the device into Lost Mode. Doing so allows me to add a number that I’m reachable at.
2. The person who has the stolen device will have turned off the device to prevent its location being displayed. They will set up a website to look like an Apple website with an email and password field that they can view when used. They will create a bogus hyperlink that looks like ‘www.apple-id.com’
3. They will now turn the device on to reconnect it to the network and doing so allows them to see the ‘Lost Mode’ phone number.
4. They will now send a text to the number along the lines of, “Dear Apple Customer, your device has been located. Please sign into your account to view the location. \[insert bogus hyperlink\]”
5. I receive the text and want to act fast so I click the link and enter my Apple ID information.
6. The scammer uses icloud.com/find and enters the Apple ID and password that they just phished from me. They will not need the 6 digit code that is sent to me, even though I have Two Factor Authentication enabled on my account.
7. They can now click on “Erase Device” and further “Remove Device from Account”.
8. The device is now no longer activation locked and free to sell or use as desired.

Here are the materials found on Apple’s website that show this as a possibility:

1. All about Lost Mode Steps: “If your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is lost or stolen” [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201472](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201472)
2. The process to remove a device from an activation lock: “Find My iPhone: Remove your device” [https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19302?viewlocale=en\_US&locale=en\_US](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19302?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)

Suggestion: Apple should notify the customer that enables Lost Mode that Apple will not text them to let them know the device has been found. Any contact on the ‘lost mode- phone number’ is by a third party: hopefully a Good Samaritan, but potentially a clever scammer.

TL:DR A scammer can steal my phone and use a phishing scheme to gain my account information and remove a device from my iCloud account, thereby removing the activation lock and rendering the device sellable/useable."

asktechnology,"Hello! I am currently trying to create a massive mosaic and am struggling to find a program that works.

Every program I have found so far (andreamosaic and etc) is outdated and runs out of memory (works for smaller mosaics). The only other options I could find were online which costs money.

I have tried allocating more memory to the process as well as borrow my friend's computer which had 30GB of RAM and 8/12 cores without any luck.

I was wondering if you had any idea on either how to fix this issue or know a better program to use that does not cost money. Thanks for the help"

asktechnology,"Hello Reddit

Sorry if this isn't the best place for this post.

First time poster. Be easy.

The small start up I work for held a company-wide meeting today. Today was my day off so a Zoom link was sent to me.

I have to download the Zoom app to join the meeting, I do so and 'dial in'. I wasn't told I would be video conferencing so that's not what I expected.

The app asked permission for my mic. I allowed. I expected another prompt asking about video but no. So I join the meeting.

Now, the entire time I'm assuming I've only joined audio, I'm not on video.

I assume this because: 

-I never gave the app permission

-I never saw myself on the screen

-There was a big red camera icon with a line through it at the bottom the screen 'START VIDEO'...meaning video was never enabled. Right? RIGHT?

I walked around my apartment in a very work-inappropriate top, went to the bathroom, walked into the next room and did other things while I only listened...

Worst of all though

Upon seeing a coworker who I've only met through text and emails, seeing how surprisingly handsome he was, I lost my shit. I silently blew kisses, kissed my phone screen, smushed the screen to my titties, etc.

Ya know, the kinds of things we do when we think no one is watching. Not thinking twice because I know I'm not on camera.

Now I'm thinking, 'could I have been on screen?' What if I actually did video conference in. WHAT IF IT WASN'T JUST AUDIO DEAR GOD

Zoom users. Please.

Please give me peace of mind. You must tap the red 'START VIDEO' icon to enable video in a meeting, correct?

I mean, seems pretty obvious but I need confirmation to be able to sleep tonight.

Thank you!"
asktechnology,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel in India, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

asktechnology,"Technically speaking, dark mode UI has been possible since the rise of color CRT monitors in the early 90s. I remember Windows 95/98 having a reverse color appearance setting for instance. And there were custom themes you could install in Linux and the classic Mac OS that were basically dark mode. Why has it only become popular in the past few years?"
asktechnology,"Hi everyone, not sure if this is the correct subreddit for this, but it seemed pretty appropriate. Please advise on where I could cross post if any of you suggest. 

Here's the lowdown:

Since 2008, my father and I have been working on what we call *The Magnetic Torque Multiplier*, but it's also known as the *Permanent Magnetic Drive Apparatus and Operational Method* - at least that's what is on our patent which can be seen [here.](https://www.google.com/patents/US8487484?dq=magnetic+torque+multiplier&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LZ3GVPeDC4SfggSl6IHwCQ&ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA) So if anyone is keen on going through the patent and reading about how it works, please feel free, we're pretty proud of it. 

Anyway, we have reached an ending point. What we want to do is get a magazine article written on our product with a history of the project, how it currently runs, what the future possibilities will be, and some cool pictures go to along with it. Perhaps Popular Science or Popular Mechanics? I hear that sometimes they love stories/products like this for an article.

What do you guys suggest? Many thanks!"

asktechnology,"Earlier this evening I saw some news about a popular MMORPG, and in the process of googling it, I clicked on a link to a popular gaming website (deliberately obfuscating them as I don't want to give them traffic).

The site I ended up at, despite being one of the internet's most popular gaming sites, was **unusable**. Half the screen was a banner ad. The site was jumping all over the place as ads appeared, before one of those interstitial popups appeared FOR THE SAME PRODUCT.

I guess I want to ask... How did things end up this way? This wasn't the case only \~5 years ago. Is it genuinely because the sites only care about views? (like if I open one of these sites, and it loads, and I IMMEDIATELY quit due to it being unusable, I am effectively a perfect customer for them?!)

Does everyone use adBlock? I've never bothered with it. I used to use a few similar tools back when genuine popups were a common thing (just to block them) but these days most browsers have that feature built in.

How does that even work? How can running major websites in a way that angers their readers be a successful business model?"

I'd call myself fairly moderate, tech savvy- ish, and sensible, but this is the benchmark I told myself I'd go cold.  I didn't feel comfortable with facebook and google, but this shit is putting my data in the hands of people I've never trusted to make a competent decision ever.  If I don't get a good enough how-to in the next week, then I'm seriously going to use every service available to scrub what I can of my past off the net, (if possible) delete every compromise-able account, app & operating system (ehem Window's X), purchase an air-gapped computer ( I imagine installing a usb-drive version of linux distro I arranged like a shady drug deal...I have no idea how to properly install that btw..or how to know I didn't get scammed), run my bank account dry and setup paper only everything, and setup dummy/allias accounts from burner computers and public wifi-spots and VPNs/proxies.  By then I'm sure I'll have learned how to properly use/navigate bitcoin or other cryptos albeit through trial and error.  I'd prefer not to trial and err though:  please someone tell me I can accomplish the same results for less effort...?? right??

PS: (mildly disgruntled stoner tone) **Fuck you if you think I'm over reacting.  Seriously, you didn't call your rep did you?; FUCK YOU**

**EDIT 1** I a word

&nbsp;

**EDIT 2.1** TAILS is an operating system on a storage medium that opens and operates directly from that medium & therefore not on the device in question.  I thought it did encryption or something and got sassy, my apologies. I will look more into this. 

&nbsp;

Can anyone point me to a How-to guide to setup, operate, and navigate Tor browsers and network?  I only have a rudimentary knowledge of that, and not the slightest clue how to get on board confidently, & safely furthermore. 

&nbsp;

**PSA**Apparently,  more people are concerned about my heart rate.  *Folks I was half asleep writing this, my tone was closer to that of a mildly defensive stoner than Tweek from Southpark.*

&nbsp;


**EDIT 3**  Y'all for Gods sake (FP)  I'm not *paranoid*, I'm pragmatically pissed off for having something **More** to manage just to live reasonably secure in this country/era.  I have been trying to lurk-n-learn fundamental computer network tech for a few years now because I felt it was a great practical tool to understand, it sure as hell is always relevant.  Despite me being in a largely unrelated field.  I've been wanting to take the dive and learn IT security, network tech, and coding for a while.  **What better time or project, than a complete reset of my digital foot print and standard operating procedure regarding the internet.?**
 
&nbsp;

Either way, Y'all can't tell me that the UX for being an american citizen ain't a far cry from what you were assured was the bare minimum expectation for the millennium. Listen, I have certain expectations about what is reasonably public, private or public yet obscured/buried, regardless of whether it is ever used maliciously. It is simply me thinking long term; I get that it is very unlikely to be used in a way reminiscent of the current list of pop culture fear-fictif.  This is simply more like my intuition telling me to step the fuck back from the creepy business owner next door who doesn't appear to know a lot about his service-as-advertised, but is enthusiastically insistent he has something special for me in the back...Step back and then buy security cameras and new locks.  I'm doing this now so I don't have to go to extra or greater lengths later **IF** it ever gets too far.  I expect that if in 6 to 20 years the only things left on the web of me largely stop or water down after this year, I won't have nearly as much to manage if something unforeseen occurs. 
 
&nbsp;

Guys, I'm not screaming here, just help me understand what I don't understand.  Or if you're going to keep fixating on this apparent caricature of my tone as discheveled, frantic and anxious, then point me somewhere that will give me the DETAILS I'm asking for:  What do I need to look out for as an first time tor-user (i.e. rookie mistakes), what is compatible, what isn't, are there scams out there I should be aware of, and if so how do I go about educating myself.  Don't forget; there is a FUCK TON of content about this on google alone, and most of it is peppered with half baked incomplete advice, and generally bad information.  Helping me sort through it all by sharing and discussing any nuance you are familiar with in a complete manner to a new comer would be... well.. golly that would just be swell ladies.  


&nbsp;


**PS** I don't connect anything to facebook; phone, sign-ins, etc & barely use it because I don't like them, or want them monetizing my personal life.  So yea I already had a foot out the door.  I do a lot with google in comparison, but thats because they consistently provided fairly reasonable & user friendly privacy & personal data management features.  Early on, I figured Facebook and Google would be brought in line in terms of privacy.  There was a very *SLOW* bit of progress that gave me hope.  At least with those services I could switch, or find other options.  I don't know if you've been paying attention, but there aren't exaaactly a lot of competing options in any given local for me to rely on.  

&nbsp;


**EDIT W/E** I mean come on guys, clearly I need a good point in the right direction.  I'm only now learning how to format blank line breaks...after 8 years on Reddit. 
   "
asktechnology,"My wife’s iPhone 11 pro was stolen right out of her hands, WHILE OPEN/UNLOCKED. 

This one’s a doozy, with many unique factors coming into play starting with the first fact that the phone was stolen while in her hands  unlocked. Spoke with a number of Apple security reps and they’re stumped. So if you have the patience to read this story, please consider offering your advice. 

Please read carefully. There are many factors to this situation that make it different than a normal stolen iPhone case. 

First and foremost, we’re abroad in Vietnam. No data/cell service. Simply relying on free WiFi, and GPS tracking. 

7:15 PM: My wife stops walking to check our location via GPS on google maps (she was not on WiFi) and I take a few more steps ahead (I’m full of guilt for not stopping as well to remain next to her, but I’m just a few steps ahead when...), a man on a motor scooter rides up on the sidewalk and snatches the phone from her hands and rides off. The phone was open/unlocked. She screams, I turn and start to chase him but he’s gone. 

7:18ish PM: Immediately we get to WiFi and log in to her “find my iPhone” account on my phone (within 60-90 seconds at the nearest restaurant). But of course, without data service her iPhone 11 is “offline”. We set it to erase which says, “erase pending, your iPhone will be erased when it comes online”. I encourage us to walk down the block and just keep our eyes open for this guy in case he’s the stupid kind of thief that stopped right down the block. No dice. 

7:33 PM: We return to WiFi in about 15 mins and check again her “find my iPhone” account. The device is still offline and erase is still pending. I realize that if we “erase” her phone we have no chance of tracking it when it goes online, so we “cancel erase” which prompts her for her password again, and we put it into lost mode. I also select, “notify me when online”. I also try to skype call Apple Support, but they’re closed. We get back to our hotel in another 30 mins, and check the app again. Still offline. 

8:30 PM: We filed a claim with Asurion and another iPhone 11 Pro 256 GB is already on the way to my parents home in the states ($199 deductible in case anyone is wondering). We’re laying in bed, bummed about the phone, but more so the violation of having that situation happen. People suck sometimes, but we’re Ok I remind us and we go out for some dinner. 

9:30 PM: We start having some other ideas, questions and proceed to discuss....the phone was unlocked when he stole it. What if he kept it open while riding away ? He can’t log into her Apple ID he would need two factor authentication for that (another one of her trusted devices that are all 6000 miles away at home) At first I thought no big deal, she doesn’t have Apple Pay setup and you still need the next level of passwords to access anything important / financial etc. and it should go locked as soon as he goes into WiFi to try anyway. 

But we want assurances. So we call Apple support which is now open. 

10:30 PM: the guy is mostly assuring us of what we thought. But to be totally certain we should change her Apple ID password. Like I said earlier you need you trusted devices to get your 6 digit, two factor authenticate code.

Ok here’s were things get even weirder. 

Approx 11 PM: I want to check for her phone again to see if it ever came online and went into lost mode. THE DEVICE IS NO LONGER ON THE LIST OF DEVICES !! Only her old phone, air pods, and iPad. The iPhone 11 is gone ! Apple support who is still on the phone with us tells us the only way that can be done is via her Apple ID. 

Our hearts sink. This guy got into her Apple ID ? How ??

Now we’re determined to change her password somehow.  So we’re calling her parents back at home to read us the code from her iPad so we can log in. We got it. We logged in and changed her password. 

So fucking weird. But then another weird thing happens. 

She’s logging into her gmail to change that password too, and we notice a “new login from an iPhone 6 at 9:32 PM one district north of our location. What the fuck ! How did this guy now get onto her gmail account, FROM HIS PHONE ! (I have an iPhone X). 

He even deleted the email that emails you when a new login happens from a new device, went to the trash and deleted that forever so we wouldn’t see it right away. It was only because we were changing her password that we saw the new login event. 

What a trip. 

Now we’re up til 1 AM on the phone with another Apple rep and she’s genuinely invested and listening to my story, but stumped. How did the phone get deleted from the list of devices ? How did he login to her email on a different device ?

Any hackers out there know how to
Do this shit ? I thought Apple had the best security. 

Just one last note, my wife is European and all her passwords were pretty complex and in her language (Slovak). A pretty strange language whether you’re a Vietnamese and/or English speaker. He didn’t trial and error guess her passwords within two hours of getting her phone. They are too difficult and random."
asktechnology,"Like with LineageOS, from what I've read there's no build that is just universally compatible w all/most android devices. There's just a ton of different builds specific to different devices. Why is it like that? What is it about the hardware/OS that makes it have to be like this?"
asktechnology,"I had 1.235 Bitcoins stolen during a web transaction.  I properly received/copied and directly pasted the receivers address.  A virus or malware variant on my computer immediately replaced the intended receiving side Bitcoin address with the BTC address of a hacker.  What am I supposed to do?  Which steps to **uninstall and remove malware AiroAV, Bit Defender,  Malwarebytes, Sophos, Avantis, Kaspersky, ESET, Avira Norton, FSecure? Please tell me what to purchase as I just lost $15k and going out of my mind.**"
asktechnology,Is there a reason for it or is it just coincidence?
asktechnology,"Sorry to be a downer on a subreddit that's probably not so emotionally intense most of the time. I'm hoping some folks that are knowledgeable about hacking can weigh in here.

When I was 17, my boyfriend took a semi-nude picture of me at my request and emailed it to me. I was posed on the couch, in a lacy bra and panties. I briefly saved it in a very hidden file on the family computer, then eventually thought better of that plan and deleted it.

Several months later, I was at my parents' home (I had moved out by then) using the computer and saw that my father had left his email account open. I'm not proud of this, but I snooped. What I found was extremely disturbing. There were two emails sent months prior with that picture attached in his outbox. There was no text, so I googled the email addresses he had sent this picture to. They were both small internet porn companies. There were no further emails to or from those addresses.

I didn't say anything about it at the time. I was too busy just trying to survive. I confronted him about it several years later. He claimed that he had never seen that picture before, that he didn't send it to anyone, and that his email account must have been hacked.

I've posed this question to a couple of tech-knowledgeable friends, and they've said that it's theoretically possible but pretty unbelievable that this could have been accomplished by hacking. It's really hard to believe that my father did this, so here I am, asking Reddit for additional opinions. Somebody please tell me there's an explanation for why/how a hacker would find the one mildly sexy picture saved to the computer and email it to two porn companies from my father's account without any text? Alternately, if it's the hard truth, tell me that my father's an absolute creep and there's no other reasonable explanation."
asktechnology,"I know it's cheesy, but I'm gonna get her to marry me. Thanks in advance!"
asktechnology,"Like the title says I have had a flip phone, my wife decided I needed to upgrade and get a more capable phone so she got me an LG Aristo. Its really BIG lol. Anyway like I said I am really new to this and was wondering what are some programs I should get to go with it? It seems kind of silly to only use it to text my wife if she needs milk on my way home.

So I was reading about fibre-optics, and the speeds of data transfer, and I came across this video from techquickie, which said that fibre-optics cable MAREA can transfer data at speeds upto terabytes per seconds, I was wondering, since fibre-optics is based on light and wavelength, 

""Would it take 1 year to transfer even 1 bit of data over 9.46 trillion km? Considering that a fibre-optic cable that is 9.46 trillion km long is made(in theory) and data is transferred through the cable, would it take 1 whole year, for the data to transfer from one end to another?(in theory that is)?""

TLDR; A fibre optic cable that is 9.46 trillion km, would transfer 1 bit of data in how much time? A year?"

Later that night I got a call back from the number and immediately answered to see WTF was going on and it was another Realtor here in town and she said she got a call from me, but I never called her. We talked for a few and realized the number she got the call from and the number I got the call from were the SAME number, and then I said you’re call is showing up as XYZ number (the one that I had missed the call from) and she said that isn’t her number and gave me her real number.

I asked her to call me back at the “fake” number she was calling from and I was going to send it to voicemail and then I would call her back.

When I was like 16 I was in a mental health treatment facility for just like 2 weeks. When I was admitted, they said I’d be allowed to have my phone to listen to music (I don’t remember if they had a rule about using the Internet/texting but the area of the facility had really crappy cell service so that was kind of irrelevant anyway) but the one condition was I had to hand over my cell phone to the staff before I was admitted so they could disable my camera. After I got it back, I remember going into my settings to figure out how the heck they did this and if there was even a way to undo it myself, just because I was curious. I literally couldn’t find anything. Despite numerous google searches I’ve come up empty handed and it’s kind of just dumbfounded me for years.

asktechnology,"I really don't know the best way to explain this, so this is basically stream-of-consciousness (sorry to be long-winded here).


I have been building a neural network engine for a while, with the intention of using it for some image-processing goals.  I am the author of the currently-defunct Sagelight editor, and intend to rebuild it with a lot of these algorithms in mind.  


When I finished the main part of the neural network and was building the convolutional layer, I needed to have test data for the neural network so that I can make sure it is still working properly as I add onto it and make it more complex.


I have a professional reputation to uphold, so I don't state the following lightly.


Long story short, after some good results with pseudo-random data, I ended up giving it lottery data from multiple states. The neural network algorithm was able to accurately predict the trends for these lottery samples, as well as some other gaming-type of data.  I was very surprised, and analyzed all data for a solid month, running hundreds of tests.  At first, I didn't believe it could be accurate, and thought I was guilty of wishful thinking. It was only after making some breakthroughs on the algorithms and the data analysis that I am ready to completely stand by results that I can reproduce.


The main issue isn't really lottery data, more that because of powerful, fast computers and our new and refreshed interest in neural networks (because they're feasible now), a lot of algorithms are discoverable by analyzing more and more discrete sets of data, some lottery algorithms just happening to be among them.


I have looked at lot of other data, but because of the math involved, these are hard to make into visual diagrams.  The best visual graphs I have show the lottery trend predictions. 


That's the problem.  There is a pre-set and pre-determined bias and unbelievable reaction to this type of data, since its something that someone would fake, innocently think they discovered, or use to scam people into something they are selling.


In my case, I came by it fairly accidentally while building something else.


Any advice on how to publicly release the information and frame it in a way that makes sense would be great.  I have a numerous graphs that show the basis for the algorithm as well as lottery trend predictions.   


Also, I wasn't sure if this was a new development, or basically been-there-done-that in the neural networking world.  But, since the CTO of a major Neural-Networking company rejected it out-of-hand (without looking at any data) on Quora -- accusing me of just being stupid, really -- it appears to be a new development.  Still not sure, though. 


It's not so far-fetched, really: the idea is that most lotteries these days are done by random algorithm, and I think we just are coming to understand now that algorithms (or at least some part of them) are discoverable by analyzing the data. When your neural network dissects data output millions/billions of times over in various math spaces and different perspectives (in just minutes, these days), a lot can be found especially if you know how to look for it (i.e. with previous samples and various algorithms).


This is related to a lot of types of data, such as stock-markets, financial, etc.  One good use for it I found was to look for holes in data algorithms; a way to find exploits that can turn into backdoors, and that sort of thing.


My background is that I am a professional computer programmer and have done some great work with algorithms in the past, including image-processing, compilers, data analysis, etc.  I've just never really published such a 
""paper"", and I can see that this particular set of data I want to talk about has controversy and possible ulterior-motive written all over it.


The reason I want to publish the data is this: the fact that this neural network (in a very primitive state) was able to predict any trend in any lottery at all is a little disturbing to me.  It shouldn't be happening, and with me just being one person, who knows what other people are working on.  Plus, as the neural network algorithm is in an inchoate state and is able to make trend predictions, I feel that it will be much more accurate once I implement some new methodology, which concerns me even more.


Anyway, any advice and thoughts on where/how to release it, talk about it, etc. would be great.

Thanks.

asktechnology,"Hello Reddit. 

Back in the 80s, the BBC used to run educational programmes about computing, teaching people how to do simple coding tasks on the BBC Micro, a massively popular home computer.

In more recent years, we've given a lot of coverage to things like the Raspberry Pi, the Maker movement and other initiatives designed to inspire people to learn more about the technology they use.

BUT - we could do a lot more. So, we're considering running a series of ""weekend tech projects"" on the BBC News website as a way of introducing some basic tech skills to people... things that children can learn together with their parents over the course of two days.

We're looking for ideas that are fun, simple but rewarding -- like coding a simple game, for example, or turning a Raspberry Pi into an alarm clock.

I thought I'd open this up to the minds here to consider.

What type of project should we look to feature?

asktechnology,"Hello all and thanks in advance for readings this. I live in a tiny rural town in Western Massachusetts. We’ve rented in this town for 5 years and are getting ready to buy the house we currently live in. We’re expecting our first child in December. We barely have internet here. When I first moved here 5 years ago, satellite internet was the only option. That was, as you can image, nightmarish. After a couple years, we were able to get Verizon DSL…which is very slow and also expensive but it’s still unlimited and at least we could use streaming services like Netflix. There is no cable TV here, only Dish Network, and we wouldn’t be interested in it even if there was. None of the bigger ISPs would touch our area because it’s rural and not that populated, there is fiber laid all through the area but none to the homes themselves. Over the last couple of years there has been a coop movement in many of the small rural towns in our area to get municipal broadbrand in through a organization called [WiredWest](https://wiredwest.net). It would be town owned and they are offering 25Mbs unlimited for 59$ and 1GB unlimited for 75$ a month via a Gigabit Passive Optical Network. There have been tons of regulatory and funding hurdles, but I have always came out to support them at town meetings and we put down a small deposit to show interest and support. 

Recently, there was another town meeting about broadband internet. Turns out now that WiredWest has passed all the funding hurdles and are ready to get going, suddenly Comcast has decided it’s going to try to swoop in and provide broadband service. It’s more expensive for slower speeds, but they are touting Cable TV. Whats more, their main selling point is that they will provide all the upfront cost to finish laying the cable so the town won’t have to foot the bill and no one’s property taxes will go up. (It’s estimated that to shoulder the cost through WiredWest property taxes will increase 150-300$ annually. Not that much for Mass which has high taxes already.) Understandably, I am mortified and scared that we are going to get stuck with comcast. Comcast is the definition of soulless corporate monster whose incompetence and consumer abuse is legendary. We are so close to getting fast, reasonably priced town owned internet. On the information sheet, Comcast actually had the nerve to say they supported Net Neutrality!! Their millions in lobbying funds would say otherwise. With today’s vote by the Trump appointed FCC to begin the process of gutting NN, this is more important than ever. 

The decision ultimately rests with the Selectboard. A preference vote by the town was more than double in favour of town run internet over Comcast. BUT this is a small town of less than 1000 residents, there isn’t much migration in or out. Many of the residents are older or elderly and have gone their whole lives without internet here. Net neutrality, data caps, Comcast’s heinous consumer crimes are not really on their radar. The members of the Selectboard are in their 60s or older. I fear that they may be swayed out of ignorance of the pertinent issues or the perception of cost savings and I want to present a letter at their next meeting outlining the following:

•	NN, what it is and why it is important. **Recent anti-NN legislation (SOPA?)** that has failed to go through, showing how this is getting shoved down our throats by corporate interests.

•	Comcast as one of the leading corporations fighting against NN. **Is there anywhere to get totals on lobbying funds?**

•	The recent vote by the Trump appointed FCC to begin the dismantling process. i.e. Comcast won’t be sticking with the supposed pro-NN stance they touted on their information sheet.

•	Comcast as one of the most hated companies in America. **Are there trusted/well known company ratings somewhere for customer service?** Some legitimate source to outline how much people hate this company.

•	One thing the info sheet didn’t talk about is data caps. I want to explain why these are bullshit and not based on technological limitations as well as a way for Cable TV providers like Comcast to disadvantage cordcutters. Also I would like to mention how Comcast has been quietly implementing them in select locations. **Where have they been putting data caps in?** 

•	Lastly I want to talk about the **benefits of municipally owned broadband.** This would be owned by the town but WiredWest which is a local coop of rural “hilltowns” in this area would be administering it. This means local control and local oversight. 

I would really appreciate Reddit‘s help with the questions I have on my bullet points. I want to make sure the letter is detailed with sources and really outlines how horrible Comcast is. I plan on making information packets for the selectboard with whatever information I can reasonably print out (consumer ratings, lobbying money information, pro-NN info, the recent decision by the FCC, etc) Any help would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks!

I'm in the first stages of the build and I'm doing some experimenting. I'm using an arduino uno to control each feeder, and using this [RFID Reader module](https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Mifare-Reader-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B07KGBJ9VG/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=rfid+arduino&qid=1566332758&s=gateway&sr=8-3) to read the rfid tags I plan to place on their collars. I would like to read their implanted chips, but they don't all have implanted chips.

The idea was to place the reader directly in front of the food dish, near where their tag would hang off of their collar. The reader would then trigger a door to open and close when the cat leaves.

Unfortunately, the range on the reader I've purchased is not ideal as it only picks up the tag from a max of 2 inches. I would love to be able to read the tag from at least 4-5 inches away and read regardless of the tags positioning.

Does anyone know of a module with a better range at a similar price point that I could integrate?

Or is there a better way to accomplish what I want to do?

Perhaps with bluetooth?

asktechnology,"I work for an international news broadcaster. We just tried to record an interview with an eyewitness to the suicide bombing in Gaziantep, Turkey. We were talking to him on a mobile phone but he apparently couldn't hear us and all we could hear was a repeated 60 second loop of what he had said earlier. The line stayed connected but the audio just kept repeating. Could this unusual behaviour be explained by any conventional malfunction of a cellphone line or device?

buildapc,"Last Saturday I posted about building a gaming computer for my son for pretty much just Minecraft.  I had $300 to work with.  I expected a few replies and a few pointers.  The response to that post was unbelievable.  I woke up the next day and my wife told me she needed to silence my phone in the middle of the night.  Over 40K views and over 300 replies.  I now know the meaning of RIP inbox.  I got a lot of great advice from a lot of people.  In the end, it was pretty clear.  I could build it for $300, but it wouldn't be great.  It may play Minecraft, but that's about it.  I would be better off spending more money on a build, and well, my wife and I didnt really have more money to put towards it.


Let me start by saying I was messaged by quite a few of you about graphics card, mother boards, processors that they had laying around. Willing to send them to me for nothing, or maybe some shipping.  The generosity of this sub is amazing.  I was never looking for anything but advice, and many of you offered many things.  For that I am very grateful.


Then I was messaged by a member of this sub who wishes to remain anonymous.  They offered to purchase a WHOLE BUILD for me.  They said they were around my son's age when they got into building computers and technology.  They now work with computers as their profession and wish they could have shared a similar experience with their dad growing up.   I was skeptical to say the least, but they were very genuine in their message and honestly I don't know how I could have said no.

Over the next few days we sent messages back and forth and he put together a build for my son and I.  My wife kept telling me its crazy and someone was messing with me.  I stayed a little skeptical but I could tell through the conversations we had that this person was truly a good person looking to make a positive impact.

As of last night, all the parts were ordered and are being shipped straight to my house.  They have sent me order confirmations as well as tracking on all the parts for the build from Amazon and Newegg.

Here is the build:

All I can say is that it is truly a Christmas miracle. 

I have never been so moved by the generosity of one person before.  I am in shock and words cannot describe the excitement I have to build this amazing computer with my son. 

I do not think I will ever be able to thank this person enough for what they have done.  All they asked in return is to pay it forward.  And believe me I will!

I will be sure to update when the build is completed!  

Merry Christmas everyone!  

TLDR: Wanted to build with my son.  Didn't have a budget that was good.  A stranger on the internet sent me $1300+ of parts to build with my son.  I still am in shock.

Edit:Spelling

Edit2: Wow. Thank you for the gold.  This community is gold. Thank you so much to everyone here.  This has been an amazing few days!  Also RIP inbox again lol


UPDATE: The Build is Complete! https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7mqw43/my_son_and_i_finished_the_build_that_an_anonymous/

buildapc,"It's not perfect, and there have been a number of times that I haven't been able to find a specific part(that I know exists but they don't have it in their database), but it's a wonderful tool that has saved all of us an unimaginable amount of time in the building process. 

I mean, imagine a world without it.

You have to double and triple check all compatibilities, look through all the different retailers for the lowest prices, write down build lists yourself. Calculate the TDP, make sure your graphics card isn't too long and your CPU cooler isn't too tall.

They do all of this for you and more. They let you store multiple lists and post finished builds. And you have all of that saved online where you can access it anywhere.

Best yet, I heard they're working on a website overhaul to make mobile use more fluid.

I want everybody who sees this to take a moment to remember how valuable PCPartPicker has been to all of us. For free. Because they believe in the cause.

Edit: of course they make their money somehow, but they don't charge us for their services

Edit 2: Happy New Year!!"

buildapc,"As the title says, everything in my PC is working, but my monitor won't turn on. I have the HDMI cable plugged into the GPU. Any idea what I can do to fix this? Thank you"
buildapc,"I bought 2 copies of Windows 10 Home OEM from Newegg.com for $85 each on sale.  This is consistent with genuine OEM pricing around $100.  They emailed me two copy/pasted keys.  Both failed to activate Windows so I called Microsoft.  They checked the keys and said both were pirated!  This is not a genuine Microsoft product!

I contacted Newegg.com and was transferred to a supervisor.  They refused to replace the keys with verifiably genuine Microsoft products and refused a refund.  They did offer to email me more pirated keys(they called them digital but could offer no evidence they were anything other than what Microsoft said). They refused to acknowledge that Microsoft confirmed Newegg.com’s keys were pirated, constantly trying to say things like, “I’m sorry you weren’t able to get your keys to work” or, “I can assure you that all of our keys are genuine, but they don’t always work.”   Fact check;  Microsoft has already confirmed these were pirated keys.  As for them not always working?  49% of Newegg’s reviews for this item are 1 Star...nearly all of them saying the same thing...the keys don’t work and Microsoft says they are no good.  Wish I’d noticed that before I bought...which is why I am here, actually.  Don’t make the same mistake as me.  I’ll be disputing the credit card charges and I’m optimistic since Microsoft has my back, but what a hassle!

By the way, I just bought a ton of hardware from Newegg that works fine.  If it didn’t, I’d be in trouble because they are notorious for not RMAing bad components, but everything I bought was stuff I’d be comfortable taking straight to the manufacturers.  7 dead pixel minimum to return a monitor!? Sometimes the deals aren’t worth dealing with a company like this.  Definitely not the place to buy software or easily counterfeit goods.

TLDR; Don’t buy software from Newegg.com.  They sold me pirated windows keys that don’t work and refuse to replace them with genuine products or issue a refund.

buildapc,"#Guide to Setting up Windows 10 & Maintaining your PC ^^Updated ^^4/22/2020

This is assuming you have successfully completed your PC build and are wondering what to do next. Here’s a few helpful tips I have learned over the years. 

**Warning:** Yee who don't like opinions, probably don't dare enter..

&nbsp;

**Windows Installation:**

Download [Windows Media Creation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10). Create a USB installation drive using the tool and boot to the drive by changing boot order in your motherboard UEIF/BIOS.

Start the install, choose “Customize Settings” and turn everything on this screen off. Proceed to install Windows with a local account. If you're okay with Microsoft collecting some data, you can always sync your Windows account later in **Settings > Accounts**. The benefit being Windows will backup your settings and can sync them with other PCs you own. 

Once you boot up, head over to **Settings > Update and Security**. Check for updates and go grab your favorite beverage and let it complete, you may reboot multiple times during this step.

Once you're done updating, go to **Start > Settings > Privacy** and go down [the list on the left](https://i.imgur.com/FZ8TqkW.png) and turn everything off unless you actually use it. 

* Same goes for background apps -- only disable apps from running in the background that you don't want notifications from. It's safe to disable background apps completely if you don't care.

* Under ""Feedback & Diagnostics"" switch that to ""Basic"". Once that is done, head to **Settings > Update and Security > Advanced Options > Delivery Optimization** and turn it off. That setting allows P2P updates across your network which is a potential security risk.

* Next head over to **Settings > Network and Internet > Wi-Fi** and turn everything off here besides the Wi-Fi itself. 

Having done all of that correctly, you have disabled the bulk of data logging, background app usage and diagnostic feedback. Yay! Windows is installed. Much of what you do next is personal preference (appearance, software, customization) but there are a few things I would like to recommend.

&nbsp;

***

**Quick accessibility tip - Open Control Panel and at the top-right change ""View by:"" to ""Small icons"". It will make more sense following this guide.** 

***

&nbsp;

**Update motherboard BIOS** - If everything is working properly, and you are happy with the performance of your PC - It is generally not recommended to update the BIOS as there is always the potential for something to go wrong. That being said, if you follow the installation instructions **exactly** from your MOBO manufacturer, you will be fine. 

* For all BIOS and firmware updates, I will refer you to your manufacturer’s support page to ensure you are getting the latest and greatest. Follow the instructions there for how to install (typically downloading the update to a FAT 32 USB drive and flashing the update in your UEIF/BIOS). 

&nbsp;

**Drivers:** Windows 10 will automatically update and install drivers for your hardware via Windows Update. This is typically fine for everything except your GPU and chipset, which we will take care of next. 

&nbsp;

**Update your graphics card driver** – Again, head over to your manufacturer’s website and follow the instructions there to install:

AMD - [http://support.amd.com/en-us/download](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download)

NVIDIA - [http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

&nbsp;

**Update your chipset drivers:** - Chipset drivers are a set of operating instructions which tells your CPU how to behave and interact within your PC. Typically these will come with a optimized power plan for your CPU which you can enable in Control Panel > Power Options. 

AMD - [http://support.amd.com/en-us/download](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download)

Intel - https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005533/software.html

&nbsp;

At this point it may be a good idea to grab [HWiNFO64](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/) (also in the Additional Tools section below) to check the internal temperatures of your CPU, GPU, etc.. to make sure nothing looks out of the ordinary. If anything appears abnormal you can try reapplying the thermal paste to make sure you have adequate coverage. 

As far as where temperatures should be. That will differ drastically depending on your cooling solution (air, water, AIO, passive), ambient temperatures, overall case airflow and cooling performance of individual hardware. Generally if you are idling and your CPU/GPU is near or under 45°-50° you are likely doing just fine. 

&nbsp;

You can also test your ram by using Windows Memory Diagnostic. Just type **Windows Memory Diagnostic** in to Windows search and it will come up. You will be required to restart your PC to test. When you are done, head to **Event Viewer > Windows Logs > System** and the results should be the most recent log (at the top). If it's not, filter for Event ID 1201. 

&nbsp;

**Change refresh rate on monitor** - If you have a 144hz or 120hz monitor, and either a DisplayPort, HDMI 2.0, or DVI-D (Dual-Link) connection, it’s a good time to look at your refresh rates. If you own an Nvidia card, change it in Nvidia control panel. For an AMD card, follow these steps:

* Right-click your desktop and choose Display settings
* Scroll down and select Display adapter properties
* In the properties window click on List All Modes
* Scroll down and choose your desired mode (e.g. 144hz) and apply

**Note:** If you have more than one monitor you will need to select the other monitor in windows display and repeat steps above. 

&nbsp;

***

**Edit:** Ehh.. Thinking back I would just ignore this part. The firmware your drives ship with are just fine. It's not worth it, just leave it alone. 

~~**Update your SSD firmware** - This may be a new concept to those coming from an HDD but your SSD’s firmware can be updated as well. To begin, head over to your manufacturer’s support page (yes again) and to ensure things go smoothly, I recommend downloading their management software. If you just purchased your SSD, you will more than likely find it is already updated. They are not frequent so if you're not concerned, feel free to skip this step.~~

~~• Crucial offers their “Storage Executive Management software”, and Samsung has “Samsung Magician”. If you own a different SSD search its support page and see what they offer.~~

~~• Crucial offers a “Momentum Cache” feature which speeds up your drive at the expense of using RAM and the potential for data loss. I go into more depth on it [in a previous post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7mf8yo/reminder_your_ssds_firmware_can_be_updated/). Personally, I’d leave it disabled if you’re happy with its performance and your workload doesn't demand it. For normal gaming and office use you won't notice a difference. Samsung offers a similar feature called ""Rapid"" and while I have not used it personally, I would say my opinion on it stands.~~

~~**Warning:** Some manufacturers may format when upgrading. *Please* **READ** the instructions carefully. I am not responsible for any data loss.~~

**Anti-virus/malware:** 

This can be a polarizing subject for some, and I can only offer my experience, but after years of searching and experimenting this is what works for me. I will also preface this by saying, depending on your browsing/download habits this can change entirely. Ultimately, my best advice on the subject is: 

#Do your research and find what works best for you.


That being said, I use the following and it's all available for free… 


**Anti-Virus:** Windows Defender – For me, Windows Defender is good enough. It’s simple, and FREE. Stay vigilant and let it run on its schedule scans and build its definitions, scan periodically if you wish.

**Anti-Malware:** Malwarebytes Free/uBlock Origin – Again, the free version of Malwarebytes is good enough for me. While browsing, uBlock will do the bulk of your malware blocking and if you suspect anything got by, run a Malwarebytes scan. I run Malwarebytes every couple of weeks personally for peace of mind.

**Firewall:** Windows Firewall. While behind a router there isn't much use for a soft Firewall, it is good for protecting yourself within your own network. E.g. if another PC on your network gets infected, it could prevent your device from contracting the virus/malware. It is also useful to create outbound rules for preventing certain applications from accessing the internet if you don't want them too. 

&nbsp;

**Additional Plug-ins for safer browsing:**

* [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) - Privacy Badger stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web.

* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - HTTPS everywhere rewrites all web requests to use HTTPS wherever possible. 

* [NoScript](https://noscript.net/) - NoScript is an open source add-on that allows JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins to be executed only by trusted web sites of your choice (e.g. your online bank).

&nbsp;

**Additional configuration:**

Malwarebytes:

* Go into the settings and enable “Scan for rootkits”.

uBlock Origin:

* The default settings will block 99% of ads and malware, but if you want more protection/AD blocking/annoyances filtering, head over to **uBlock settings > 3rd party filters**. I enabled all uBlock filters (except Experimental), all “Ads” filters (except mobile), all “Privacy” filters, all “Malware Domains” filters and all “Annoyances” filters. 

I’ve never had any issues browsing or viewing content while using these settings, but to each their own.  If you have issues you can always reset to default on the settings home page. There is said to be a drop in performance if you are doubling up on items in your lists, but if there is it's negligible and I haven't noticed any. Other than that, the worse that can happen is that you increase the chance of rendering a page incorrectly. Not a bad trade off for peace of mind while browsing.

&nbsp;

***

**Performance Monitor:**

Windows should be mostly configured at this point. I'd recommend running this report to see if Windows detects any issues or has any suggestions about your current setup. If you receive passing grades on everything, pat yourself on the back. If you received a fail or warning, don't panic, just read the suggestion and follow the instructions on how to resolve it:

1. Open a 'RUN window' by pressing the 'Windows key + R'
2. Type **perfmon /report** and hit Run
3. Wait and check your results

&nbsp;

I like to routinely check **Reliability Monitor** just to see how my system is doing day to day. It will report any critical errors or update failures so you can, well... see how ""reliable"" your system is. If you go 5 days without any critical errors reported than congratulations you have a very healthy system. Also, keep in mind the extent of the error reported. If Malwarebytes crashing shows up as a critical error or crash, I don't think that's a good representation of your system health. Some stuff is unavoidable, Windows isn't near perfect. 

Along with Reliability Monitor, keep an eye on **Event Viewer** to track any errors you may come across. It should be your first step in troubleshooting issues. Ignore any ""DistributedCOM"" errors. They've been around since Windows 8 and everyone gets them, they're harmless. 

&nbsp;

**CPU Overclocking:**

There is a huge community behind overclocking, and while it can be fun to eek out extra scores in benchmarks, it honestly isn't worth the hassle of the average PC user. On modern Ryzen and Intel chips, algorithms have been built into account for this and will automatically clock frequencies up and down depending on thermal performance. If you bought a CPU in 2018 or later, my opinion would be to just let it do it's thing. 

&nbsp;

**XMP Profile / Overclocking RAM**

Enable your XMP profile in BIOS so your RAM can run at its rated speed. There are too many different boards and ways to do this, so just type your ""motherboard name + XMP Profile"" into Google to see how to do it.

***

**Maintenance/Upkeep:** 

Windows Disk Cleanup. Nothing against CCleaner, but it's unnecessary and deletes valuable Windows Defender files. Also, it comes with a registry cleaner which **shouldn't be used for any reason.** 

Realistically, if you're not pressed on hard drive space or experiencing issues, there is no reason to run a cleaner of any kind. If you run Windows Disk Cleanup just understand what you are cleaning before you check mark it for deletion. 

&nbsp;

**Registry:**

Your registry is essentially a Windows database that informs your operating system and applications how to behave and appear. That being said,  **Don't use registry cleaners**. While CCleaner is harmless when used correctly, messing with your registry always creates the potential for harm. You will never see any measurable performance increase from using a registry cleaner.

If you know what you are doing, the registry is a fantastic tool for making UI or OS changes (e.g. removing the ""3D objects folder from File Explorer, removing OneDrive, etc...). As always, just make a backup first.

&nbsp;

**Defragging your HDD** - Probably don't need to do this often, once every month or so, or after very large frequent file writes. FYI, Windows automatically sets a schedule to defrag your HDD every week by default.  To change the schedule or run it manually, go into **""My PC"" > Right-click your HDD > Properties > Tools > Defragment**. Analyze the drive and if it's over 10-15% fragmented, considered running the defrag.

**Do NOT use third party tools to defrag your SSD.**

**Note:** The native Windows 10 defragger is smart enough to know this, it won't give you the option if you try. Instead, what you will find is that Windows does a version of defragging once a month by default called 'Optimizing'. You can read a really good article about it [here](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheRealAndCompleteStoryDoesWindowsDefragmentYourSSD.aspx). In short, don't worry and let Windows do its thing. 

&nbsp;

**Backup:** 

I use Windows Backup and Restore. I'm sure there are more comprehensive tools out there, some 3rd party ones which were suggested below, but there really isn't anything more comprehensive than creating a system image. You can do this by navigating to **Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > Backup and Restore (Windows 7)**. Once I have set up Windows to my liking I create a system image and store it on an external drive or a secondary HDD, preferably both. Do it periodically if you have the space. You will thank yourself if you ever run into an issue and need to restore from an image. 

You can also use the Full or Incremental backup feature, but I prefer just to have a system image on hand in case of a failure. Backup all of your important files and documents to the cloud so they are safe from system coruption and accessible across your devices. Google Drive is a great tool. 

* A system image is an exact copy, or clone, of your drive in that particular state when you created it. You can use it to restore the system after a catastrophic crash, hard disk failure, etc...

* A Full Backup contains data files, but not everything on the disk. You cannot use it to restore the system.

&nbsp;

**System Restore:** 

Go to **Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > System > System Protection**. Chose your C: drive and click ""Configure..."". Turn on system protection and choose a percentage of space you have to spare. 5% is typically more than enough. Use this option if you ever have an issue and need to restore to a particular point in time - before a faulty Windows update for instance. 

&nbsp;

**UPS:** 

If you can afford to buy one, buy one. For those who don't know what they are, UPS stands for Uninterruptible Power Supply. I own two APC models I got from Amazon and living in Florida, they've saved my ass during many o' thunderstorms, power outages, brownouts and surges. Keeping a steady flow of electricity to my PC, it's good peace of mind to have. 

If you are wondering, it is okay to plug a UPS into a quality surge protector like the Tripp Lite Isobar 2, home UPS devices typically don't have high joule ratings (surge protection). 

&nbsp;

**Physical Maintenance:** 

I'm sure everyone has their own routine for this step, and depending on where your PC is located it may require more frequent cleaning/dusting. Always keep pressurized air (duster) handy. Once every few months or whenever you notice a dust build-up, open it up and blast it. **Hold your fans in place so you are not spinning the blades, this can generate an electrical current and potentially damage your circuit headers**. I would avoid using any sort of vacuum attachments as there is a good risk of damaging your components. For tempered glass, use a microfiber cloth to buff out any smudges. Glass cleaners are safe to use on tempered glass, but I would still dilute them so your mixture is half-water, half-cleaner. Other than that, find a nice cool place with good airflow to keep your machine running smoothly. 

&nbsp; 

***

**Extras (optional steps):**

**Calibrate monitors** – Windows has a color calibration tool built-in. Or if you’re lucky enough you will find a guide for your specific monitor. Just do a Google search for “Calibrate + Your monitor model” and see what kind of information is out there. Tom’s Hardware had a good one for my AOC and I have noticed more defined colors since doing it.  

**Enable High Performance power plan** - Go to Control Panel > Power Options and choose the ""High Performance"" plan. 

**Disable “Enhance pointer precision”** – Go to Control Panel > Mouse > Pointer options and uncheck “Enhance pointer precision”. This will give you more control over your mouse while gaming. You can read more on it [here]( http://www.thewindowsclub.com/enhance-pointer-precision-windows).

**[Disable Cortana](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/features/how-to-disable-cortana-on-windows-10-1683223)** – I don’t know who uses Cortana, but it annoys the hell out of me. 

**[Disable OneDrive](https://www.howtogeek.com/225973/how-to-disable-onedrive-and-remove-it-from-file-explorer-on-windows-10/)** - Only if you don't use it, I prefer Google Drive. 

**[Disable Fast start up](https://www.howtogeek.com/243901/the-pros-and-cons-of-windows-10s-fast-startup-mode/)** - If you have an SSD, disable this. It will not affect restarting your PC, but when doing a shutdown it will not reinitialize drivers meaning any driver related issue you were having before your shutdown, will persist when booting up the next time. u/agent268 has a very informative [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/4x7n41/psa_disable_fast_startup_to_force_windows_to_load/d6dghtm/) on it. 

**Disable Remote Connections**  - Go to Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > System > Remote settings and uncheck ""Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer"". Below that select ""Don't allow remote connections to this computer"" if you are not remoting in to it.

I followed all instructions, read every manual. My dad made me do a book report on every component before I could buy it, so I thought I knew what to do. i used the anti static thing on my wrist during the build, watched all the you tube videos, and I dont know what else to do. Thanks for any help.

UPDATE: So it was the 4Pin power supply. We were using the wrong cord for the Graphics Card (the 8 Pin) and once we switched them around, we got fans and beeps. We had unplugged alot of stuff, so we will work on it in the morning. Thank you to everyone that helped us!"

https://newegg.com/products/N82E16814487291?cm_re=gtx_1050_ti-_-14-487-291-_-Product

Its $216.  We have 4 kids and I can’t afford that for one gift for one kid.

He plays COD, Overwatch etc etc on it so he’s a gamer, I just am not sure what I can get that’s comparable or somewhat close for less than this.  

Currently he’s using a vid card that 4+ years old, so anything at this point would probably be an upgrade.  

Thanks so much guys for your help 

-----------------------
EDIT:  
All I can say is WOW.  I certainly didn't come here expecting this, I was only looking for advice for alternatives.  Just... wow.   I figured it would be fitting to do a quick edit to let you all know what the plan is with the video card droxgh04 is so thoughtfully sending to my son (partially taken from one of my earlier replies on this thread).

My son is going to see this thread, and I couldn't be happier. Im going to give him the video card that droxgh04 is giving him, the tag will say FROM ""droxgh04"" and not me, which will be confusing to him but amazing to see. I'm also including a complete print out of this entire thread (sans neg comments and the dildo discussion above which was completely fascinating, but not appropriate for his dad to include for him).  I'll take pictures when he opens the gift, reads the thread and post it all here after Christmas day.

Thanks to droxgh04 and all of you here, my son is going to learn an incredible lesson far more valuable than getting just a video card from his dad on Christmas. Now, he's getting a gift from a complete stranger who turned a simple question into an inspiring moment which has seemed to impact a couple thousand people.   So thanks to you droxgh04, Branden isn't just getting a video card from you for christmas, but he's getting a lesson of giving, and along with a box full of humanity.

Thank you all so much.   I'll DEFINITELY be paying it forward, and I hope all of you do the same as well.

Merry Christmas!"
buildapc,"I informed the seller they sent me the wrong card, they told me it was their mistake and I could keep it. I got the drivers installed and checked GPU Z, so it’s not a fake card.

buildapc,"I've had my PC for 3 weeks and thought I've been using 144hz this whole time, but when calibrating my monitors today I noticed they were sitting at 60hz still. Here is how you check, of course you need a monitor capable of 144hz and a DisplayPort, Dual-link DVI or HDMI 2.0 connection. 



[Picture Guide](https://imgur.com/a/rPfPy)



* Right-click your desktop and choose **Display settings** 

* Scroll down and select **Display adapter properties**

* In the properties window click on **List All Modes**

* Scroll down and choose your desired mode (e.g. 144hz) and apply

* If you have more than one monitor you will need to select the other monitor in windows display and repeat steps


Hopes this helps some others who weren't aware of the setting. I'm not sure if Nvidia has the option natively in the menu but I couldn't find it my AMD settings. 

**Edit:** A couple people pointed out Nvidia has the option in its settings, and also apparently HDMI 2.0 supports 144hz. 

**Edit:** Woke up to my first gold this morning. This is the best Christmas ever! Thank you :)



*To the Ebenezer Scrooges calling us noobs, etc... for not knowing. I'm sure that like me, many just assumed buying a 144hz monitor, would well, be in 144hz. There is no shame in learning. Merry Christmas everyone!*"
buildapc,"UserBenchmark just got banned on r/hardware and should also be banned here.
Not everyone is aware of how biased their ""benchmarks"" are and how misleading their scoring is. This can influence the decisions of novice pc builders negatively and should be mentioned here. 

Among the shady shit they're pulling: something along the lines of the i3 being superior to the 3900x because multithreaded performance is irrelevant. 
Another new comparison where an i5-10600 gets a higher overall score than a 3600 despite being worse on every single test: https://mobile.twitter.com/VideoCardz/status/1250718257931333632

Oh and their response to criticism of their methods was nothing more than insults to the reddit community and playing this off as a smear campaign: https://www.userbenchmark.com/page/about

Even if this post doesn't get traction or if the mods disagree and it doesn't get banned, please just refrain from using that website and never consider it a reliable source.

Edit:
First, a response to some criticism in the comments: 
You are right, even if their methodology is dishonest, userbenchmark is still very useful when comparing your PC's performance with the same components to check for problems. 
Nevertheless, they are tailoring the scoring methods to reduce multi-thread weights while giving an advantage to single-core performance. Multi-thread computing will be the standard in the near future and software and game developers are already starting to adapt to that. Game developers are still trailing behind but they will have to do it if they intend to use the full potential of next-gen consoles, and they will. userbenchmark should emphasize more on Multi-thread performance and not do the opposite.
As u/FrostByte62 put it: ""Userbenchmark is a fantic tool to quickly identify your hardware and quickly test if it's performing as expected based on other users findings. It should not be used for determining which hardware is better to buy, though.
Tl;Dr: know when to use Userbenchmark. Only for apples to apples comparisons. Not apples to oranges. Or maybe a better metaphor is only fuji apples to fuji apples. Not fuji apples to granny smith apples.""

As shitty and unprofessional their actions and their response to criticism were, a ban is probably not the right decision and would be too much hassle for the mods. I find the following suggestion by u/TheCrimsonDagger to be a better solution: whenever someone posts a link to userbenchmark (or another similarly biased website), automod would post a comment explaining that userbenchmark is known to have biased testing methodology and shouldn’t be used as a reliable source by itself.

and my personal favorite pcpartpicker.com - it lets you build your own PC from a catalog of practically every piece of hardware on the market, from CPUs and Fans to Monitors and keyboards. The prices are updated regulary from known sellers like amazon and newegg. There are user reviews for common parts. There are comptability checks for CPU sockets, GPU, radiator and case sizes, PSU capacity and system wattage, etc.
It is not garanteed that these sources are 100% unbiased, but they do have a good reputation for content quality. So remember to check multiple sources when planning to build a PC

buildapc,"This story is so unbelievable I’m still processing it but long story short my roommate came from the bars last night and brought his girl with him. She came into my room at 5am thinking it was the bathroom, sat on my computer and started peeing. I have opening vents at the top so the urine dropped down into my computer and the MOBO and GPU. (It’s the Meshify C case if you were wondering). I opened it up immediately and dried it down with a towel, the GPU, the MOBO, and everything else I found the liquid on. Right now it’s drying next to the window pointed at the sun. How long should I wait to test it? Is there anything else I can do to hopefully preserve it? I’m hesitant to unplug cables and take out the parts because it’s been 4 months since I built it and all my PC building skills are nonexistent, completely. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do, thank you.

edit: i appreciate all the advice and awards, however, please don’t send me any more awards. i’m not sure if it costs money or what but just please keep it to yourself. i just browse reddit i barely make posts. I will be trying the tips in here and i’ll keep you guys updated. thank you so much for the advice.

The answer is always the same: YES. But I've never seen anyone saying something else that I feel is more important.

Nevermind your bills,  ≈ 500Wxhr/hour x 10 hours is [on average](https://blueskymodel.org/kilowatt-hour) **2.6kg (or 5.7 pounds) of carbon dioxide going into the air nightly**. If 100 million people worldwide do this, that's a quarter of a billion kg of CO2 every night. I am not saying PCs are killing us, because that's just a ""drop"" of water, considering the other emissions we have, but this is a plain waste of energy that our environment can't really afford. **Hibernate your computers**, and powering them on will take half a minute or less.. don't be lazy and take this approach with you, whatever you do.

&#x200B;

EDIT: While idling, the PC consumes less than 500W, it really depends on the build and I'm not sure what the average nation-wise would be, but that's just a 2-5 factor.. the point stands (we still have to multiply our number for 365 if we want the waste by year...)."

buildapc,"No one will probably see this but whatever. Need to say something because it genuinely makes me feel bad. I frequent this sub and it's the first place I come to when I have a specific question about my PC or build. Unfortunately, I've posted many times with questions I couldn't find the answer to or would take too long for me to confirm on my own and almost always received no responses. 

It seems to me from my time here that posts with funny content, or posts that show someone's dumb ""mistake"" make it to the front page easily and are met with tons of conversation and discussion. But when I check out the ""new"" section, it's filled with legitimate questions that I feel would be very easy for knowledgeable people to answer, yet they're all empty and downvoted. 

I'm not angry that I have been trying all day to get some feedback on my PC upgrades, but only a couple of people have given me a minute of their time. But I do feel kind of sad especially for the younger folks on here trying to get some help with their first or second builds or have a burning question. I'm also not saying people aren't doing enough on this subreddit I just feel this subreddit was meant to be a place where beginners could get help from more experience people and it certainly does not that feel that way. 

Maybe I'm in the minority or maybe I'm the only one feeling this way but I really like this subreddit, and it's unfortunate I have to go to subreddits like pcmr to ask questions about my build. 

Anyway, please downvote if I'm spouting nonsense which I very well may be. Thanks for reading.

Edit: I appreciate people helping me out now, and I'm sorry if I sounded a bit angry in my post it's been a long day. I still do stand by it though, and would love your opinions if you have any!

I understand it's impossible to help everyone and there's far more questions than people able to answer them. This is my personal experience as I have been browsing this subreddit for more than a year and feel this way currently. But I've read your responses and I appreciate you letting me see the other side of this. 

As someone reminded me, the daily questions thread is another place to post as well. 

Last Edit: I'm going to bed now I really can't believe the response to this post and I'm very glad it stirred some genuine discussion about the topic. I think it's best to not look at it from a sides point of view and we should all just try to be patient and help each other out as much as possible. Thanks to a lot of you today I learned a lot and will pay that forward. 

E3: okay I just woke up and this is absolutely insane. So first off a lot of people are calling me elitist or cunt and I appreciate your contribution to the discussion. Here is the thing. I've found from experience it has been easier to get support or advice when posting about a build on OTHER subs  than this one. Whether thats pcmr or a smaller sub, it justs frustrated me that a subreddit dedicated to helping with builds had a severe lack of exactly that. I'm not blaming anyone and its okay if you think I'm being elitist but thats how I viewed this sub. And obviously my views have shifted thanks to all the discussion going on here, so again thanks for participating."

buildapc,i sat here for a whole day trying to fix my newly built pc as why it wouldent connect to my monitor only to find out i didn't even plug it into my monitor
buildapc,"**Note:** Not sure if this is true for any other Windows besides Windows 10, and not sure if this has been fixed already or not (as I haven't enabled it since then).

&nbsp;

Quite a few months ago, I found it weird that my laptop was using around 40-50% of my RAM while idle (no application open at all) out of my 8 GB.

After searching for a bit I saw a possible fix that made no sense for me as ""why would this work"", but indeed it did work. Both to me, and to a friend who also was asking why he was using so much ram. Two others did it and I believe they still saw some ""improvement"" even if not that great.

The fix was very simple for me: to disable Windows tips and tricks.

&nbsp;

**To do so, just follow these simple instructions:**

&nbsp;

* Press the Window key (usually between CTRL and ALT) or click the start icon.

* Search for ""Notifications"" and press ""Notifications & actions settings"".

* Disable ""Get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows"" by clicking on it.

* Restart your computer.

&nbsp;

This worked for us at least, and it went from around 40ish% to 20ish% of RAM usage, to which I believe is where it should be at.

I apologize if this can't be posted here and I apologize if this doesn't work anymore, but hopefully (I think?) it does and it helps someone out.

**Cheers.**

&nbsp;

**EDIT**: Woke up and saw I had been gifted gold (my first gold, yey!) and I believe some coins/platinum/premium (I'll still have to check what exactly are those about, not really sure what they are) so thank you a lot gifter! (Don't know if he allows me to say his name so I'll not post it, at least for now).

&nbsp;

Some are saying not to disable this as unused ram is wasted ram. While this is true, to me at least, tips and tricks are also useless so there is no need for me to enable them.

&nbsp;

**Other (hopefully) fixes that might be helpful:**

&nbsp;

* If your disk usage is a lot of times at 100% on idle and you find yourself with office installed, stopping the ""ClickToRun"" (I believe that is the name, don't yet have office installed to confirm) service while not needing to use office might make the 100% usage to stop.

* Not sure if it was CPU, RAM or Disk usage regarding Windows Defender, but sometimes it will try to scan it's own folder and will be stuck on a loop while doing so, so you might want (not sure if recommended) to add Windows Defender folder as a folder to not search virus from on Windows Defender Settings (don't remember exactly how you do it but I believe that's what made my friend reduce the usage he had).

&nbsp;

Anyways, regardless of wanting unused RAM or not, hope I helped someone.

&nbsp;

**Edit2** Thank you for the platinum kind stranger."

Please help"
buildapc,"*EDIT/PREFACE: The issue here is that the motherboards that contain a series 100 chipset are natively incompatible with Intel's 7th generation CPU's (Kaby Lake). This can be fixed with a BIOS update of the suspect motherboard.*

*Not all motherboards with the 100 series chipset will have the updated BIOS upon shipment.*

*If you buy a Kaby Lake CPU and a 100 series chipset motherboard that does not have the BIOS updated at the factory*, **then you cannot use that motherboard unless you have a spare Skylake CPU lying around that you can pop in and flash the BIOS with, then go back to your Kaby Lake CPU.**

*There's a chance that you will be lucky and recieve a motherboard that has the updated BIOS, but there's no surefire way to tell unless the retailer explicitly states that the BIOS at the latest revision with Kaby Lake support.*

*I recommend a motherboard with the B250 chipset for any multiplier-locked Kaby Lake, and a motherboard with the Z270 chipset for any multiplier-unlocked Kaby Lake.*

Just yesterday there were 4 posts where people had put together their systems and everything turned on but no display, because they purchased a 100 series motherboard with a Kaby Lake CPU.*

Just yesterday I and multiple other members had to warn at least 15 people who's builds included a 100 series chipset with a Kaby Lake CPU. None of them had any idea it was an issue.

Are the 200 series chipsets really that unknown? I don't understand why anybody would pair the newest CPU with an older chipset, considering the Kaby Lake/200 series were released alongside each other for the purpose of being used together, just like the Skylake/100 series.

PCPP does offer a warning, but it's not nearly large enough. Even then, people will still ignore it.

This is happening way too often and a lot of people are getting screwed over after having unboxed their components only to have them not work after building the system up and plugging it in. Then they spend hours troubleshooting every component, reseating everything - completely oblivious to the fact that they received a 100 series motherboard with an old BIOS.

This is a pretty significant issue, and it's unacceptable how many times this is occurring.

ASUS has publicly responded.   [https://www.asus.com/News/hqfgVUyZ6uyAyJe1](https://www.asus.com/News/hqfgVUyZ6uyAyJe1)

&#x200B;

TLDR: Admitted compromise.  They said only a version of Live Update for NOTEBOOKS were affected, not desktops.This is despite previous news articles so I apologize for any confusion.  ASUS offered their own zipped tool to check your machine for infection [here](https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/Apps_for_Win10/ASUSDiagnosticTool/ASDT_v1.0.1.0.zip).  The newest Live Update, version 3.6.8 is fixed and is no longer compromised.  It includes multiple security mechanisms along with end-to-end encryption.  They also said they have strengthened their server-to-end-user software architecture but did not disclose how (usually you don't want to tell your adversary what you're doing to protect yourself so I understand).

In the end, if the ""here"" link/zip file above shows your machine was infected, ASUS states the following:

*Immediately run a backup of your files and restore your operating system to factory settings. This will completely remove the malware from your computer. In order to ensure the security of your information, ASUS recommends that you regularly update your passwords.*

&#x200B;

I hope this finally puts and end to this.  Make sure you're updated to the latest version, regardless of Desktop or Laptop software.  Thank you all for the comments

**ASUS has responded to me:**

 

Hi GadgetryTech, thanks for reaching out to our team. We do apologize for the inconvenience and will be more than happy to assist. ASUS Live Update is a proprietary tool supplied with ASUS notebook computers to ensure that the system always benefits from the latest drivers and firmware from ASUS. A small number of devices have been implanted with malicious code through a sophisticated attack on our Live Update servers in an attempt to target a very small and specific user group. ASUS customer service has been reaching out to affected users and providing assistance to ensure that the security risks are removed.

ASUS has also implemented a fix in the latest version (ver. 3.6.8) of the Live Update software, introduced multiple security verification mechanisms to prevent any malicious manipulation in the form of software updates or other means, and implemented an enhanced end-to-end encryption mechanism. At the same time, we have also updated and strengthened our server-to-end-user software architecture to prevent similar attacks from happening in the future.

Additionally, we have created an online security diagnostic tool to check for affected systems, and we encourage users who are still concerned to run it as a precaution. The tool can be found here:

**Edit 5 for clarity:**

This only affects ASUS machines running Live Update that was downloaded between June and November of 2018.  That puts approximately 3-4 million machines sold by ASUS in that time frame, in addition to downloads from the web.  It's likely that this malware is on your machine, but is dormant because only 600 specific MAC addresses would trigger the next stage of the malware.  As of now, even if you have the malware it's likely not doing anything.  Instead, this exposes a huge security oversight and example of attacking at the vendor/source level.

**Original Post:**

I posted this on /r/Hardware but received a message thinking it would be good for the BuildaPC community as well, which I agree.

Hi everyone,

I did a post instead of just a link because it's important to discuss details, and most people do not read articles, just headlines. Anyway, here's the link first:

[https://motherboard.vice.com/en\_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers)

And a second, more technical/less fluff link from Kaspersky themselves: [https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/)

&#x200B;

**Important Note:** According to the articles, Asus has not been responsive to Kasperky regarding this incident. They still have yet to notify any customers as well.

&#x200B;

This malicious activity seems to have been noticed since late last summer, by folks in the [/r/Asus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asus) community: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/8qznaj/asusfourceupdaterexe\_is\_trying\_to\_do\_some\_mystery/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/8qznaj/asusfourceupdaterexe_is_trying_to_do_some_mystery/)

&#x200B;

**Summary:** It appears the attackers compromised an Asus Live Update server a long time ago to get an old setup.exe binary. After weaponizing it, they were able to digitally sign the malicious software with a valid Asus digital certificate. Certificates are a great way to slip past a lot of AV software.

&#x200B;

**Timeline and Scope:** Starting last year, it looks like this malicious payload was pushed for at least 5 months. It is estimated that at least 500,000 computers were/are infected.

**What can you do?**

For an automated cleanup and check, here's a tool from Kaspersky to check for the Shadow Hammer infection: [https://kas.pr/shadowhammer](https://kas.pr/shadowhammer)

For manual cleanup, I would make sure your live update tool is the newest version if you intend to continue using it. Remove and clean any prior version of the update tool prior to installing the new one. A good method is to boot into safe mode, remove the tool, and check c:/ProgramData and your AppData folders (3 main ones) for anything to do with Asus live update. Remove those, then reboot and install a clean updated.

&#x200B;

**Best practice (edited to include comments around laptops):**

Auto-update tools from various vendors can always be used as a weaponized payload delivery mechanism, just like a compromised website. It's best to stick to reputable sources for items like drivers or anything that gets root access to your system kernel. For graphics drivers, only use AMD, Nvidia, and Intel sites directly (unless you have a laptop). Same with Intel NIC drivers, chipsets, etc. Please note that some laptops require vendor specific drivers for hardware to work properly, which will bring you to sites like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Toshiba, etc. I hope this helps you all in protecting yourself!

&#x200B;

I am posting this in Hardware, Intel, AMD, and Asus subreddits to spread awareness.

Edit 1: Apparently the ASUS Z390 chipset UEFI can copy files to your drive once Windows is installed, even if you did not do so yourself.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Thank you /u/iamapizza for the new link and quick comments on helping people find their MAC address.  If you all want to see if your MAC address was targeted by the malware (MAC address is the physical address for your networking adapter, not an IP address):

You can check if your MAC address has been targeted here, no need to download anything:

[https://shadowhammer.kaspersky.com/](https://shadowhammer.kaspersky.com/)

To get your MAC address(es) on Linux you can use ip -o link

On Windows just use ipconfig /alland get the Physical Address

&#x200B;

Edit 3: The scan tool above only checks if your MAC was targeted.  It does not check for malware.  Follow Edit 2 if you want to check your MAC without using the tool.

Edit 8: More news -  [https://www.wired.com/story/asus-software-update-hack/](https://www.wired.com/story/asus-software-update-hack/)  It seems as though other MAC address are on the target list as well, but no one is sure what hardware that correlates to.  It's perhaps a future target, but no sign of infection outside of Live Update.  Kaspersky is still unsure of what would happen in the second phase of attack, or what the attackers planned on doing with the specifically targeted machines."
buildapc,"So yeah this is embarrassing.  I am 6'2 200lbs very normal size.  Good hygiene blah blah.

Whenever I play video games my ass sweats immensely.  Literally as I type this it feels like there was just a rain storm on my asshole.  I am sure the chair I use, which is cheap and thick on the bottom, kind of creates a furnace from sitting for long periods of time.

Perhaps a chair with a meshy or more breathable bottom would suit me better, but I also don't want to buy a cheap piece of shit chair either.

Any help would be great because I am sick of having to wipe my ass during loading screens.  I could seriously water a small flower garden just by pulling down my pants and twerking above it.  

Also, I do kind of have an hairy ass crack...I am sure that doesn't help but I have tried shaving it before and within a few days it feels like someone is punching my asshole with a sandpaper fist covered in sriracha.  So...I am not sure why I mentioned my hairy ass but perhaps there is some advice out there.  Like sprinkle some ketchup on my ass hair or something crazy I wouldn't think of.

Please help.  My butt is wet.

buildapc,"#These are just my results using my PC with a certain benchmarking tool. YMMV. I encourage you to run your own tests as what may be true for my PC may not be for yours.

Edit: I should make it clear that I am *not* testing how games run *across* the extra monitors -- just how framerates change with the monitors enabled.

Also thanks so much for the gold!

Edit 2: /u/Afteraffekt pointed out that the cause of the framerate drops when playing YouTube videos on the additional monitors is simply that they are being rendered along with the game and *not* that they are being displayed on the monitors. After testing this he seems correct. I've added the data from these extra two tests (8 and 9) below.

---

So I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6kh1td/will_a_2nd_monitor_lower_fps_even_when_inactive/) a few days ago and got some mixed responses. Most were saying that the difference would be marginal, although [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6kh1td/will_a_2nd_monitor_lower_fps_even_when_inactive/djmubpq/) seemed certain that I would see stutters and significantly lower FPS in games with a second or third monitor.

I decided to test this using Universe Sandbox ²'s benchmarking tool. Now, the interesting thing with my setup is that the right monitor is actually connected to the motherboard (thus powered by my i5's iGPU) whereas the left and centre monitors are both powered by my GTX 1060 3GB. I ran ~~7~~ 9 different tests:

1. Both side monitors disabled
2. Right monitor disabled
3. Left monitor disabled
4. No monitors disabled
5. YouTube video playing on left monitor
6. YouTube video playing on right monitor
7. YouTube videos playing on both side monitors
8. One YouTube video playing in the background with both monitors disabled
9. Two YouTube videos playing in the background with both monitors disabled


My system is using the following specs:

- Case: Aerocool Qs-240 (with 2x Arctic F12 Silent 120 mm)
- Motherboard: Asus H110M-R
- CPU: Intel Core i5-6500 (SR2L6)
- CPU cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212X
- RAM: 2x4 GB HyperX Fury DDR4 2133Mhz CL14 (in dual channel)
- SSD: Samsung 850 Evo 250GB
- GPU: EVGA GTX 1060 SC 3GB
- PSU: Corsair VS550 550W 80+

I should also note that Shadowplay was running throughout all of these tests. I tried to keep things as consistent as possible, but high repeatability will always be difficult to obtain with benchmarks due to the unpredictable nature of PC components. I kept Steam offline during all of my tests to prevent any stutters due to notifications, and the only other program I had running in the background of my PC was EVGA Precision XOC (which I use to set a custom fan curve on my GPU).

Anyway, here are my results:

#Test 1 -- no additional monitors enabled

- Run 1: 121 avg. FPS
- Run 2: 123 avg. FPS
- Run 3: 122 avg. FPS
- **Average: 122 FPS | Range: 121-123**

#Test 2 -- one additional monitor, powered by the GPU

- Run 1: 120 avg. FPS
- Run 2: 122 avg. FPS
- Run 3: 123 avg. FPS
- **Average: 122 FPS | Range: 120-123**

#Test 3 -- one additional monitor, powered by the CPU

- Run 1: 123 avg. FPS
- Run 2: 122 avg. FPS
- Run 3: 122 avg. FPS
- **Average: 122 FPS | Range: 122-123**

#Test 4 -- both additional monitors enabled

- Run 1: 122 avg. FPS
- Run 2: 123 avg. FPS
- Run 3: 121 avg. FPS
- **Average: 122 FPS | Range: 121-123**

#Test 5 -- YouTube video playing on left monitor, which is powered by the GPU

- Run 1: 119 avg. FPS
- Run 2: 120 avg. FPS
- Run 3: 121 avg. FPS
- **Average: 120 FPS | Range: 119-121**

#Test 6 -- YouTube video playing on right monitor, which is powered by the CPU

- Run 1: 118 avg. FPS
- Run 2: 117 avg. FPS
- Run 3: 116 avg. FPS
- **Average: 117 FPS | Range: 116-118**

#Test 7 -- YouTube videos playing on both additional monitors

- Run 1: 115 avg. FPS
- Run 2: 116 avg. FPS
- Run 3: 115 avg. FPS
- **Average: 115 FPS | Range: 115-116**

#Test 8 -- one YouTube video playing in the background, no side monitors enabled

- Run 1: 118 avg. FPS
- Run 2: 115 avg. FPS
- Run 3: 114 avg. FPS
- **Average: 116 FPS | Range: 114-118**

#Test 9 -- two YouTube videos playing in the background, no side monitors enabled

- Run 1: 114 avg. FPS
- Run 2: 114 avg. FPS
- Run 3: 116 avg. FPS
- **Average: 115 FPS | Range: 114-116**

#Conclusion: 

#Using extra monitors does not appear to affect FPS in any way, even when content is being displayed on them -- the lower FPS seen in tests 5/6/7 are due to the videos being rendered, *NOT* due to them being displayed on the additional monitors. (The FPS appears just as low, if not lower when the videos are playing in the background with the side monitors disabled.)

Honestly, I was expecting a much larger difference. I should note that Universe Sandbox ² is probably more CPU-intensive than GPU-intensive, which could explain the lower FPS when powering the monitor with the iGPU.

Hope this helps some people!

Additional notes I'm adding to try and eliminate any confusion:

 - The videos were played with the default YouTube layout, i.e. not full-screen or in 'cinema mode'. I did this specifically because I felt more people viewed videos like this but I apologise if this was incorrect of me.
 - The side monitors are both 1366x768 in resolution and the centre monitor is 1680x1050. Both monitors run at 60Hz. Some have suggested that mixing monitors with different refresh rates can cause microstutters, which /u/Kezz92 claims can be fixed by disabling Aero transparency [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6le4kr/do_extra_monitors_really_lower_fps_i_ran_a_series/djtf3am/) but I do not have a high refresh rate panel I can use to test this.
 - The side monitors are completely inactive for tests 2-4 -- simply displaying my desktop background (which is simply a solid grey colour). When I say they are disabled I mean that I have disabled them within Windows (to the same effect as unplugging them)."
buildapc,"A lot of the build help request we see on here is from people wanting to ""max out"" games, but I generally find that this is an outdated term as even average gaming PCs are supremely powerful compared to what they used to be.

[Here's a video that describes what I'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5ZsaavKNR8)

Maxing out a game these days usually means that you're enabling ""enthusiast"" (read: dumb) effects that completely kill the framerate on even the best of GPU's for something you'd be hard pressed to actually notice while playing the game. Even in comparison screenshots it's virtually impossible to notice a difference in image quality.

Around a decade ago, the different between medium quality and ""ultra"" settings was **massive**. We're talking muddy textures vs. realistic looking textures. At times it was almost the difference between playing a N64 game and a PS2 game in terms of texture resolution, draw distance etc.

[Look at this screenshot of W3 at 1080p on Ultra settings](http://cdn4.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/witcher3_03_Ultra.png), and then compare it to [this screenshot of W3 running at 1080p on High settings](http://cdn4.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/witcher3_03_High.png). If you're being honest, can you actually tell the difference with squinting at very minor details? Keep in mind that this is a screenshot. It's usually even less noticeable in motion.

Why is this relevant? Because the difference between achieving 100 FPS on Ultra is about $400 more expensive than achieving the same framerate on High, and I can't help but feel that most of the people asking for build help on here aren't as prone to seeing the difference between the two as us on the helping side are. 

The second problem is that benchmarks are often done using the absolute max settings (with good reason, mind), but it gives a skewed view of the capabilities of some of the mid-range cards like the 580, 1070 etc. These cards are more than capable of running everything on the highest **meaningful** settings at very high framerates, but they look like poor choices at times when benchmarks are running with incredibly taxing, yet almost unnoticeable settings enabled.

I can't help but feel like people are being guided in the wrong direction when they get recommended a 1080ti for 1080p/144hz gaming. Is it just me?

TL/DR: People are suggesting/buying hardware way above their actual desired performance targets because they simply don't know better and we're giving them the wrong advice and/or they're asking the wrong question."

buildapc,"After finally experiencing the upgrade from HDD to SSD myself this year, it was painful to watch my mom wait 5-10 minutes on a cold boot for her computer to be usable. So I bought her a 240 GB Sandisk SSD (35 USD) from Best Buy for Christmas and plopped it in, and cloned her old drive. The whole process took about 2 hours and her husband was on the verge of freaking out the entire time that I was going to break something.

Now that it’s done however, my mom with her basic Dell i3-6100 computer called me at 3 AM to tell me she hasn’t stopped using her computer since I left at 8 PM. She said she can’t believe how much more responsive everything is now, and even her husband is impressed. But he thinks the speed up is partially because I blew a bunch of dust out of the CPU heat sink.

She said now she might actually shut her computer off now at night instead of putting it to sleep since start up time is just as quick. 
If a loved one in your life is still using old HDDs, do them a favor and bring them into modern hardware life with an SSD. 

Next gift idea, small PCIe powered GPU so she doesn’t need to play Sims 3 on integrated graphics."

**Pricing**

The CPU, MB, RAM, and CPU cooler were $43 as a combo from Ebay; they were listed at $35 + $10 shipping, but I made an offer for $33 + $10 shipping to save $2. That seems like nit-picking, but $2 is 2% of my budget! I split up their prices somewhat evenly on PCPartPicker, but you can probably get a Q6600 for under $10 and the RAM for a similar price, but the mobo is likely the most expensive part of that combo.

The 120 GB SATA1 2.5"" HDD was $6.49 shipped from Ebay, but after 30 days, I was strangely refunded in-full and the seller didn't reply to any of my messages, so I technically got it for free. 

The GPU and PSU were listed as $60 on Craigslist, but I literally messaged the seller and told them I was on a super strict budget and couldn't offer more than $36. Miraculously, the seller took my offer. 

The case was my only non-used component. It was $24 on-sale from Newegg and had a $10 rebate making it cost me $14 which is amazing for a case that comes with three 120mm fans.

**Overclocking**

The GT 740 SC 4 GB DDR3 was overclocked for my original and second-round of benchmarking with +90/+200 using MSI Afterburner. No artifacting or crashing occurred with this overclock during any of my tests or just when I was playing Rocket League for fun :)

The big change this time is I overclocked my Intel Core2Quad Q6600 (released in **2007!**) by 25%, going from 2.4 GHz to 3.0 GHz. This was achieved by [putting a tiny piece of electrical tape over a single pin on the CPU, aka a ""BSEL"" mod,](https://i.imgur.com/9xo8uj0.jpg) which forces the CPU and motherboard to clock the CPU at 3.0 GHz! I initially thought that the stock Intel cooler wouldn't be able to handle that overclock, but actually, it was totally fine. This was really important, because I didn't have enough room in my budget to buy an aftermarket cooler... remember, I was sticking strictly to $100 or less!

**[Album of benchmark results, including 1% and 0.1% lows, at 720p, 900p, and 1080p.](https://imgur.com/a/8BMBAN8)**

The system was way better than I anticipated *especially* after the CPU overclock. Basically every game I tested was playable at 720p, with PUBG being the only real exception (but even then, we pulled 30 FPS average). Overwatch, Rocket League, and several older games were absolutely playable even at 1080p. I will say that I seriously had a blast playing Rocket League as I'd never tried it before this project (I bought the game *just* for benchmarking this PC), and it ran great. This project also got me to go re-live some of my older favorite games, such as Just Cause 2.

I have made [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id3K9pOGapU) that goes into a little more discussion about how the games ran, as well as [my older video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UHTt563xfk) that showed the parts and a build montage for anyone interested, but almost everything you need to know is in this post or my older post. I actually completed this project a couple months ago but never had time to make this write-up or the accompanying video, and in that time, I re-sold the CPU, MB, RAM, CPU cooler, and GPU on Ebay which completely re-paid the $93 I spent on the build. I plan to sell the PSU and HDD later on, but I'm keeping the case since it's really quite awesome to use for test-builds in the future.

**tl;dr:** I built a PC using (mostly) used parts for under $100 and played a buncha games on it. I then overclocked the CPU by 25% using a piece of electrical tape and played the games again. I really enjoyed myself and plan to do this again in the future and really encourage you to do so too if you have an itch to build but don't ""need"" to build right now."
buildapc,"So I have made a website https://envybits.com/ that can build or upgrade computers automatically, with some help of machine learning, lots of data entry and quite a lot of coding and debugging.

Now, I know it's not yet optimal so I would like to see if you can beat it and what improvements/changes would you suggest (essentially, check how it performs at different budgets and build types). Eg. if it recommends a really bad CPU/GPU combo in a given budget, puts too little RAM etc. From my own tests it seems to be doing fine in most situations and can help out people new to it but would like it to be checked by you guys too. In particular ""upgrading old computers"" (also known as Upgrade Planner) is really hard to check by just myself.

(Note - US prices are up to date, rest of the world is unfortunately a bit out of date so I would refrain from using them too much).

Some of you might remember me from last time - since then a lot of things have changed (for the better I hope!) and new features have shown up - mobile friendly UI, Game Planner aimed for people who want to play a specific title but don't actually know what kind of computer will run it so they don't know how much they should spend and hopefully better treatment of microATX/miniITX builds."
buildapc,"(ITS FIXED NOW)

Maybe we can get this upvoted so people can post their lists here and knowledgeable People can confirm or deny compatability."
buildapc,"I never knew you had to get a special cable and select what refresh rate you wanted. Talk about a waste of money. Anyway, I am getting a dvi dual link or a display port, what should i get?

buildapc,"**This guide is now outdated. I will release a new one in the summer of 2017.**

Whenever I build or imagine a new PC, I can never decide on the right budget. I tend to continuously add incremental upgrades until the system is too powerful for what I need, and then I do the reverse. It's hard to settle on a budget. I had some free time recently, and I decided to exploit my indecisiveness and suggest 19 PC builds for you, at $100 budget increments, from $200 to $2000.

It's clearly impossible to suggest a one-size-fits all build. I was aiming for what I believed the average consumer would want at each price point. I optimized the builds for a healthy mix of productivity and graphics performance, not aesthetics, storage, or features.

It's important to note that the price points are approximate. It's difficult to optimize and progress the builds properly while adhering to the budgets strictly. Therefore, some overshoot to accomodate a significant jump (e.g. a more powerful graphics card) while others are not much different than what precedes them. In addition, prices and rebates vary significantly over time. Therefore, to be safe, assume that any build may fall within the range of its price point and the next.

I've made a number of changes since my initial post, based on community feedback (thank you so much, everyone); new hardware (e.g. the GTX 1050 Ti and the Samsung 960 Pro); and my own thinking. Therefore, some of the discussion and comments below won't be relevant to the most updated version of the list.

I plan on posting a brand new list when Kaby Lake launches. Alternatively, I could keep updating this list periodically. Please let me know which you'd prefer.

Thanks again, everyone, for your input, discussion, and criticism!

buildapc,Is there any truth to this?
buildapc,"Well, it's safe to say that I didn't expect such a large reaction to my last post. RIP my inbox indeed. Thanks everyone for sharing your routines and PC uptime preferences!
There were a lot of opinions on what was best, and lots of differing opinions on the safety of leaving PCs on constantly vs. shutting down regularly.

I decided it would be fun and informative to send a few emails to some bit component manufacturers and see what they thought. It's a big of a mixed bag, but TL;DR there isn't a consensus, though most say it's better for your components to shut down for the night, or when you aren't going to be using your PC for a few hours.


Here are the responses I got:


**EVGA**
>Other than fans and mechanical drives either way will not have an appreciable impact on the lifespan of the components during an average upgrade cycle. The fans and hard drives may ware out faster if left on 24/7 however unless it is a dusty environment the fans may outlast the system. Please note that sometimes windows and power supplies may become unstable after very long periods of up-time so it is best to turn off the system from time to time.
Regards, EVGA


**ADATA**
>Dear customer Thanks for supporting ADATA product. It won't impact the normal use.
Best Regards, ADATA Technology


**MSI**
>Thanks for contacting MSI technical support.
Regarding your concern, if you don't need to use it for weeks/months, you can shut down it when you don't use it. Thanks!
Thanks for your cooperation in advance!
Best Regards,
MSI Technical Support Team


**Samsung (1)**
>Thank you for contacting Samsung. With reference to your email, I understand that you'd like to know if shutting down your PC every night would wear out the components faster when compared to the PC left ON for weeks. I'll be glad in helping you with the required information.
If you use your computer multiple times per day, it’s best to leave it on. If you use it for a short time - say an hour or two - just once a day, or even less, then turn it off during nights and you can turn it on during the mornings or next use.
Hope the above provided information would be helpful.
Kind regards,
Aravind B Email Support SAMSUNG Customer Support Center


**Samsung (2)**
>Thank you for contacting Samsung Support regarding your concerns and inquiries. We apologize for any inconvenience this may be causing you. powering off the system would help the drive last longer overall.
Thank you for contacting Samsung and have a good day! IE


**Seagate**
>Thank you for contacting Seagate Support. I understand that you would like to know if shutting down your computer daily causes more wear. I apologize that this information is not more readily available to you. I will be happy to assist you.
Shutting down a computer does not cause more wear on a drive. If this inquiry concerns an internal drive in the computer, it will most likely help the drive last longer as internal drives are typically certified to work so many 'power on' hours. These are typically based on the general five days a week, eight hours a day.

Heather Seagate Support


**Nvidia**
>Thank you for contacting NVIDIA Customer care.
My name is Imran and I will be assisting you in the query that you have.
From the email description, I understand that you want to check regarding the shutting down of the system.
Please be assured that I will do my best to help you further or point you in the right direction.
Shutting down the system would not affect the system components. It is always advisable to shut down the system when not in use as this would increase the life of the system

**ASUS**
>Thank you for contacting Asus, my name is Paul and I will try my best to assist you with your situation.
Unfortunately you have not mentioned what ASUS product this is about. However generally speaking, it's best to simply turn off the computer when you are not using it.


There was quite a lot of data in the comments of the last post, and I was thinking of collecting it and maybe making a spreadsheet/graph out of it. If enough people want to see it collated I'll do it. 


Well there you have it. A special mention to the EVGA customer support rep, who responded within five minutes of my question, and who I feel gave a very thoughtful and complete answer.
I especially enjoyed the link in the Crucial email that was basically L M G T F Y. Made me laugh :)

Edit 3: Another response from **Western Digital**

>Thank you for contacting Western Digital Customer Service and Support. My name is Marco. 
I understand from your email that you would like to know which process will wear out the disk faster to improve lifespan.
It may be better actually if you turn off you PC whenever you are not using so the disk is not spinning and is not being used. This will avoid long time uses and also local electrical instabilities that may affect your data.
If you have any further questions, please reply to this email and we will be happy to assist you further.

buildapc,"If you are in the process of putting together your dream build or you've already built it and want everything to work as it should performance-wise then you're in the right place. Much of the content below is common knowledge for some people but for those who are building for the first time or have been out of the cycle for a while, I believe having a compiled list of quality-of-life tips is very helpful; and why are we here as a community other than to help each-other?

The following list will cover both hardware and software aspects in a hopefully relevant order. Here we go.

*****

### **Important Category**

*****

1. **Checking if you are getting the advertised performance out of your new build; the easy way for everyone: UserBenchmark**
* Many people will dismiss this tool because of its way of ranking together all the stock and overclocked components. In reality, UserBenchmark is really a great way to *start* diagnosing if something's not working right.
* When running this tool make sure that your system is as idle as possible (close background apps) to reduce margins of errors (bad results for CPU/storage/etc).
* To download and run the tool, go to [https://www.userbenchmark.com/](https://www.userbenchmark.com/)
* Once the testing is done (usually takes 1-2 minutes max), you'll be taken to a webpage where you can see a report of each of your components. If there are any blatant performance issues with your PC, you should be able to identify them by looking at the report.
* Don't be bummed out if your component says ""performs below expectations"". In many cases that is reported because you're running stock components (CPU/GPU/RAM) versus an average on the website that may be overclocked.
* After identifying potential issues, its time to dedicate some time and start tweaking your machine to your liking.

*****

2. **Having the memory running at rated speeds. Or above.**
* I've seen many cases of builders that assume their RAM will run fine as it is. In reality, lets take DDR4 RAM for example; its base speed is 2133MHz and everything above that is technically an overclock. Don't make the mistake of getting superior RAM (like 3000MHz) and letting it run at inferior speeds; go into your BIOS and set XMP in your memory profiles. It usually takes 1 minute and 2 clicks to save you from sluggish performance and getting your money's worth of performance out of your RAM modules.

*****

3. **Making sure your RAM sticks run in Dual Channel.**
* If you have more than 2 sticks, mainstream motherboard from both Intel and AMD allow you to run them in ""Dual Channel"" where not only you'll have the full capacity of the sticks but also double the bandwidth. This helps a lot tasks such as gaming (especially low 1% & 0.1% FPS) and latency-sensitive workloads. UserBenchmark and CPU-z can instantly tell you if your sticks do run in Dual Channel.
* Most boards' RAM channels are A1, A2, B1, B2 in this order and their manufacturer's manual recommend putting one RAM stick in A2 and the other in B2 **but this might differ for your motherboard** so I highly suggest reading the manual section on Dual Channel memory when slotting the RAM modules. Dual Channel performance is free and it shouldn't be neglected.

*****

4. **Keeping your motherboard updated.**

* Motherboard updates come with a variety of microcode tweaks and optimizations that boost the mobo's capability of regulating voltage, supporting memory and enhancing overclocking potential. Motherboards should be kept up to date but not necessarily every time a BIOS update appears. A good recommendation would be to read the changelog from the manufacturer's website to see what's changed and try to avoid Beta BIOSes. Don't break it if it works and while you have the necessary features.
* When a socket is new and not yet optimized, its recommended that you keep getting the updates as religiously as possible because the few months after a CPU architecture release will be the most fruitful when it comes to microcode optimizations. Ryzen is a good example here.
* **Important.** Don't be discouraged when doing a BIOS update; they are much easier and safer to do than they were in the past. There's an abundant amount of failproof measures that make sure you can't brick your motherboard even if you're doing something stupid. These range from BIOS filechecking before updating and rollbacking to USB Flashback and Dual-BIOS features.
* The most common BIOS update way is to get your BIOS file from the manufacturer's website and copy it to a FAT32-formatted USB drive before going into the BIOS and doing the actual flashing.

*****

5. **Keeping your OS updated.**
* I get it. Many of you included myself hate when Windows starts doing its thing and interferes with your session but OS Updates are really the best way of ensuring the best security and performance of your system. For example, the Windows scheduler has been greatly upgraded to benefit multicore systems much better than before.
* Schedule your Windows updates at night or when you're off to work and they'll never bother you while making your system a better place. An alternative is to read changelogs and update manually when you feel like its needed. Windows Update can be disabled by pressing *Ctrl + R* and typing *services.msc*; you can use this to disable the ""Windows Update"" service down in the list.

*****

6. **Undervolting/overclocking/tweaking the CPU.**
* Certain CPUs have the ability to overclock their cores (eg. Intel K cpus, Ryzen*) because its simply free performance that's otherwise left on the table. I am not going to go into details here because there are lots of overclocking resources out there that you can read to make this process a breeze.
* I've put a star next to the Ryzen because there's something important to note here. Ryzen 2000 and 3000 CPUs benefit from a feature called PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive). ELI5: This feature allows the CPU to have a dynamic multiplier which does more than just boost a few cores to advertised speeds. It takes your motherboard's VRM capacity and your cooler's thermal capabilities and smartly adjusts the clockspeeds and voltages to provide the maximum performance needed in your workload (be it gaming/rendering/idle browsing); It essentially works very similar to Nvidia's GPU Boost 3.0 but for CPUs.
* Having this feature is a lifesaver for people who are not so knowledgeable with overclocking because it guarantees that your CPU has the best possible computing ant thermal performance out of the box. It almost eliminates the need to all-core overclock (or using P-states) and like some people claim, including myself, the fun in tweaking your CPU. The feature is clearly a highlight of the Ryzen CPUs.
* **Overlooked tip.** Ryzen 3000 series BIOSes let you tweak the Infinity Fabric speed of the CPU. Being decoupled from memory speed (unlike it was in previous generations), it can be tweaked to your liking for more performance ( [LINK](https://youtu.be/vJQKjyBiX_I?t=679) ).
* Fan curves will be addressed later.

*****

7. **Undervolting/overclocking the GPU.**
* Similar to how you can get free performance out of the CPU, the GPUs can also be overclocked for increased graphical power/framerates. Guides are everywhere as well.
* I will specify though that in many cases, GPUs come overvolted from the factory and even though it sounds weird, many GPUs benefit a lot from decreasing their voltage and then overclocking them. This is because GPUs hold their clockspeeds in relation to thermals and having a lower voltage definitely helps here.
* I would love to go in detail for this section but I want to remain concise with this post. Rambling is for discussion.
* Similar as in the CPU section, fan curves will be addressed later.

*****

8. **Setting Power Plans in Windows.**
* You can go into detail and make a custom power plan for your needs but sometimes its sufficient to set High Performance inside your Power Plan settings to enjoy a boost in performance.
* The benefits occur due to you telling Windows how to manage resources inside your systems; good examples are CPU boosting states and how your PC understands if your PC is idle or in need of a burst in performance.
* On Ryzen systems, you will likely benefit more from setting the ""Ryzen Balanced"" powerplan.

*****

9. **Setting the right refresh rate of your monitor.**
* There are many (horror) stories out there with builders getting a really nice high-refreshrate monitor (eg. 100/120/144/165/240/etc), forgetting to adjust the Display settings and essentially not noticing any gain in smoothness because the monitor still runs at a default 60Hz. Some have been sitting on that for well over one year not realizing there's something wrong.
* To make sure you're running your monitor as its been supposed to, go to *Desktop* > *Right-Click* > scroll down & *Advanced display settings* > *Display adapter properties* > *Monitor tab* > Set a global system refresh rate there.
* Another additional point here, related to the monitor is to make sure you're using the right cable and the right port to connect your monitor. If you have a dedicated GPU, connect your monitor to it. If you want to use the CPU's iGPU (if it does have one), plug your monitor in your motherboard. Please note that some systems will need to enable the iGPU option inside the BIOS before it will work. A decent starting point for choosing the best cables for your monitor is this [article](https://www.pcgamer.com/displayport-vs-hdmi-which-display-cable-should-i-use-for-my-monitor/) but the majority of the monitors will come with an included cable that's suitable for the monitor's specs.

*****

10. **Keeping your GPU drivers updated.**
* I believe this needs no introduction. Rendering performance consists of how well the GPU hardware communicates with your system and this happens through software. 
* Keeping drivers up to date is an easy way of having access to the latest features/optimizations and it can also resolve a lot of bugs and issues. This should be higher in the list based on importance buy I feel like the upper items are more frequently neglected than this one.

### **Do-it-if-you-want-to Category**

*****

11. **Testing your components right before building a PC.**
* This is not usually stressed enough. It doesn't usually happen but one can be unlucky enough to get a part that is factory broken; a DoA part. 
* Testing a motherboard debug's response by connecting the 24pin ATX cable and shorting the power pins may save you many painful hours of having to take apart a build that you put hard work in.

*****

12. **Cable managing.**
* I can't stress enough how this impacts your build both in the short run and the long run.
* A messy case interior will be bad for case airflow, component updates, cleaning, overall looks and the list can go on. Bad cable managing can be harmful for the components (eg. loose cable interfering with a fanblade).
* A tidy case that is logical to understand will be a pleasure to work on during the life of the build. So take 30 minutes to make sure cables are where they're supposed to be (cases nowadays have an abundance of options for cable management). Once you do this several times you'll get better at it and do it on the naturally, on the run, as it will become a common best practice.

*****

13. **Airflow, fan curves and dust filters.**
* Well built cases are optimized to cool the interior components by providing a way for the cool air from one side of the case (intake) to go to the other side of the case (outtake) and cooling the internals in this process. This is called airflow ( [LINK](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/xideal.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.dWjRMVYhz_.jpg) ).
* Airflow can be adjusted in many ways but a simple rule of thumb is making sure your intake fan(s) capacity matches the outtake fan(s) capacity thus creating an equal case pressure (eg. 2x120mm intake fans, 2x120mm outtake fans). 
* Having more intake capacity will cause a positive pressure inside the case and essentially an ineffective way to provide good air circulation for the exhaust. Having more outtake fans (or in some cases no intake fans at all) will cause a negative pressure inside the case. No cool air coming from outside the case will severely limit the performance of your components and in many cases it can favor dust gathering on your components.
* Fan curves are closely tied to cooling and they can be individually set for the case, CPU cooler and GPU cooler from the BIOS and softwares like MSI Afterburner. These help optimize your cooling and noises in a graph where fan speed depends on temperature.
* Cases with front mesh tend to be better in airflow than cases with a closed front so do research before getting the X case ""because its pretty"".
* Last but not the least, dust filters are there for a reason. Nobody wants a dusty case that can electrically damage components or provide sub-par cooling performance. This is why, though its recommended that you do a general clean-up of your case once a year, you just need to do a dust filter maintenance from time to time. Powering off your machine, taking out and cleaning the dust filters is simple and very effective.

*****

14. **Take control of how your multicore system manages tasks with [ProcessLasso](https://bitsum.com/).**
* An extraordinary tool for power users that can set CPU core affinities per app (similar to how Task Manager can but permanent), adjust SMT/HT settings and squeeze performance out of the CPU when its supposed to. Its essentially a tool that helps users who know their workloads well and know how to split the CPU resources to benefit the most out of them.

### **Nice-to-care-about Category**

*****

* Cases with tempered glass panels are fragile. Be careful when handling it or you'll need to cleanup the little glass shards in no time. I surely did regret it on my first tempered glass build.

* On most motherboards, the top PCIe slot is the best place to connect your GPU. Bandwidth and performance may be hampered if you connect your GPU to the other slots.

* If you're using PCIe storage like M2/NVME drives, note that at least two SATA ports will be disabled on most motherboards; usually the last two ones. Manuals will tell you about this but its a pain to get your build setup just to notice your storage devices are not recognized fully.

* Don't put too much pressure when screwing down the CPU cooler. Most CPU coolers are millimetrically adapted to the socket so that they create a small space between the CPU IHS and the cooler surface for the thermal paste. Screw them down with the force of three fingers or based on manual instructions.

* Rather small build detail but present on a lot of case types: If you'll want to cable manage the case and bring the CPU cable to the upper-left port of the motherboard, many times this cable's head won't fit through the narrow gap between the motherboard and the case metal. It is recommended that you pull this cable through there before screwing down the motherboard so you avoid having to do this after other components have been mounted.

### **Nice-to-know tools**

*****

* A great and up-to-date system monitoring tool is [HWInfo64](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/)

* Get information about the CPU, memory and perform brief stress testing with this well supported tool: [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html)

* The same as CPU-Z but for GPU information, [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/) handles every piece of information about your GPU from BIOS and driver versions to clockspeeds and memory manufacturers.

* [Macrium Reflect](https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree) is a great tool for cloning disks. Its especially helpful when upgrading to faster storage; eg. when switching your bootdrive from an old HDD to a fast SSD.

* [Ninite](https://ninite.com/) grants easy essential software installation on a fresh Windows copy.

And this pretty much sums up this checklist. I realize this is not complete but its good information that will help people not hit the same difficulties that I've hit in the past. I'll try my best to update this if I remember about anything else. 

Peace!"
buildapc,"I just came home to my CPU and Motherboard boxes waiting for me. However the Mobo box was much heavier than I expected. Much heavier.  Turns out they shipped 20 MSI Mobos to me. 

I called support and told them what happened and she told me I can keep them. I don’t believe her so I will be keeping them because the store is for sure going to want them back. If not idk what to do with them.

buildapc,"***Disclaimer: VERY long post ahead, one that almost saturates the 40,000-character Reddit limit. I hope to help the younger or more inexperienced system builders out there, and anyone confused or stuck at some point. I encourage you younger and inexperienced builders to read through the whole thing, and others to skim over at their pace. Also, since this is based on my experience over a decade of building AMD rigs and the Ryzen rig I built recently over the past couple of months, a lot of examples use AMD systems. Regardless, most if not all that advice and experience can be applied to Intel systems, and I’ve done my best to do so. Happy reading!***


Greetings fellow Redditors,


I’m writing here today to share with those of you eyeing that shiny new build some advice on that topic. This will be from experience I have gained over the years and indeed, gained over the past few months that were spent obsessing over the Ryzen build I’ve just finished piecing together.


A little background on myself is in order: I’ve been a pc enthusiast for slightly over a decade now, and have recently earned a Master’s degree in the field of Computer Science. You most certainly do not need any qualification of that nature to be doing this simply because no engineering or science degree in the field will teach you this stuff. PC building ultimately relies on its community of enthusiasts and DIYers to continue enriching the shared knowledge pool for all of us out there. Indeed, I started building back in the 9th grade and am happy to say I haven’t blown anything yet and the local power station still exists. So, without much ado, here’s the system I’ve just built:


Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 OC’ed to 3.7GHz @ 1.275v

Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-AB350 Gaming 3

Graphics Card: Gigabyte AORUS GTX 1080 Ti 11GB

RAM: 16GB (8x2) Corsair Vengeance LPX 3000 @ 2933MHz CL16 (XMP)

PSU: Corsair RM750x

Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB (Primary OS & Applications)

Crucial MX300 275GB (Game Drive)

Western Digital 1TB mass storage hard drive

LG 34UM60 2560x1080 75Hz Freesync display (Soon to be replaced by an Acer Z35 G-Sync display)


All this in a NZXT S340 Elite case


Yes, that’s a good high-end build beyond which point the effect of diminishing performance returns looms really large currently. Many of you reading this will be quick to point out the smaller game drive SSD (and you’d be right there) and will definitely point out that a 2560x1080 panel is not enough for this build and why pixel density for that resolution at 34” is poor. Allow me an opportunity to counter that in the section dedicated to monitors in this post. Maybe also the B350 chipset instead of an X370. Let’s break it all down, component by component:


**Considerations in choosing a processor:**


Risking backlash, I’m going to say this flat out: buy the fastest factory-clocked chip you can buy without telling yourself you’ll overclock it to match the faster chips. This is in stark contrast to the overclocked Ryzen 1700 I’ve put into my own build. Here’s why:


1.	You’re going to tell yourself you’re saving money on the chip and being very smart, but will spend that money on a X370 board “for the beefier VRMs and overclocking features” and will then convince yourself you need a 280mm radiator because who buys a 140mm one, right?
2.	Companies like AMD and their motherboard manufactures like to make overclocking sound very easy, they make many videos of it and when you see experts from these companies reiterate how easy and quick it is, you tend to believe it. It’s not that simple and requires more work.


The companies will make it look easy because the chipset designer like AMD wants to sell you the X370 chipset for a multitude of reasons: one, they may have higher margins on those than on processors themselves and two, because once they’ve got you to invest in a top of the line board, they’ve effectively sold you onto their platform and made you reluctant to move away. Along with making you very unlikely to shift away from their ecosystem, they also might have sold you few more future processors supported by the socket and motherboard! Motherboard manufacturers like it because, come on, it’s obvious: the boards cost more.


While we’ll talk about the motherboards next, focusing on the processors for now, overclocking them can be expensive. Let’s consider the cost: a Ryzen 1800x is $500 (can be found at $429 easily now days) and a Ryzen 1700 is $330 (can be found around $270 I believe). That’s less than a $200 price difference. An X370 board will often cost a $100 over the B350 board I picked up, and the water coolers range from $110-$160. You’ve most probably spent more already, if not as much. Yes, you can overclock with a B350 + an air cooler, but most of you will not do that. You’ll see the videos, read the reviews and say “Oh I want to stick with Ryzen for long, I’ll just get the ‘better’ board with the overclocking features.” Factor in a better air cooler for even $50, and the cost difference between a R1700 and a R1800x vanish. The difference is even smaller with the R1600 and R1600x. Yes, you’ll also need to buy a cooler with the “x” marked chips, even then, you’re not saving a significant amount, if you’re saving any at all, that is. 


As for overclocking itself, keep in mind you need to fidget a lot with voltages and every time you think you’ve found a stable voltage, you need to stress test it for many, many hours before being sure. Some enthusiasts will say 24hrs, some will say 48, some will say “hey if doesn’t crash on a Prime95 SmallFFT or Blend test in an hour, you’re gold because gaming won’t stress it as much anyway” and they’re right with that. What do I say? Given that a machine can fail a stress test at even the 30th hour and be deemed “unstable”, do it for as long as you’re patient. If you’re okay with keeping the rig on all night only to wake up and see it crashed and its experiment time again, go ahead. I don’t have that patience, I need something that just works, good and fast. Most of you do too. 


Another point to this story: voltage requirements change over an extended period of time as the CPU mildly degrades from an overclock that’s not been thoroughly tested. Case in point: I had my R1700 pass a couple hours of the Prime95 SmallFFT CPU torture test when clocked to 3.65GHz @1.18v. Fast forward a couple months when I started noticing mildly weird behavior from my system, and it bluescreened in 2 minutes of that test. Now it’s at 3.7GHz @ 1.275v, having passed several hours of SmallFFT again. Will it degrade again? Who knows. How can I ensure against it? Thorough stability testing. What comprises that? Who knows, you’ll get many different accounts. Get the fastest factory-clocked chip. Look at overclocking as something you’d do to extend the life of the CPU for a couple extra months or maybe a year before replacing it. The 1800x and 1600x overclock to 4.0GHz on 2 cores and 4.1GHz on one, that’s already great for most games out there that are single thread heavy (like GTA V and Far Cry 4). The couple extra frames you might get from future games is simply not worth it, especially if you manage a Freesync or G-sync display on your rig.


This advice applies just as well to Intel chips. Get the fastest factory clocked chip, but with Intel, also do try to get the ‘K’ or ‘X’ marked chips for the unlocked multiplier. Why? Because Intel upgrades are always costlier since you most likely need to change your motherboard as well. So a chip capable of some overclocking might really extend the life of your rig, just ask the i5 2500k owners!


**Considerations in choosing a motherboard:**


Now this is my favorite topic, and the component I spent the most time researching. Why? Because of how everyone seems to love justifying getting the most expensive board out there. There’s always a good reason: “beefier VRMs, dude!”, “more I/O, dude!”, “SLI, dude!”. 


First up, I am not suggesting you get a 1800x and shove it onto a $60 A320/B350 board. Nah, that’s another extreme. Likely because those boards were not really manufactured with the thought that they’d be graced with a top-of-the-line chip, and may actually have weaker VRMs. But look at some of the top B350 boards which are known to officially support an 1800x very well. You’ll have no problems running it, maybe even overclocking it a bit. But really, consider the future proofing excuse, AMD recently stated these first-generation Ryzen chips were “the worst-case scenario” considering the new architecture on a new process node. Future chips will only have higher clocks at lower voltages, meaning an adequate VRM such as those on the top B350 boards would do just fine. Also, most VRMs on X370 boards are already known to be overkill for current Ryzen chips. Personally, I rank the beefier VRM reasoning as the weakest one for an expensive motherboard.


Continuing our look at some great B350 boards, they have the same awesome ALC1220 audio codec as their X370 counterparts, solid build quality, BIOS recovery facilities like Dual BIOS and some other goodies like the diagnostic LEDs on the Gigabyte boards, and they cost a $100 less than their equivalent X370 boards. Talking of I/O, since many fear the lack of adequate SATA and USB ports, speaking from my experience my Gaming 3 board comes with 7 USB ports, 4 of them are taken up by the keyboard, mouse, speaker and the USB WiFi dongle. That still leaves me with 3 USB3 ports. On top of this, I get two extra USB 3.0 port along with a couple USB2.0 ports for the front from the motherboard, and simply use them for any external device I connect. Point being, I still have adequate empty slots. The board I have comes with 6 SATA ports. Ryzen itself provides for 2 of these, and I believe you lose them should you attach an M.2 SATA drive. Considering the miniscule real-world difference of using even a NVMe drive which we’ll also speak of soon, I’d say 6 ports is really overkill for 99% of the PC users out there. Granted my use case and yours would differ, but I doubt by very much even with high-end builds.


Let’s talk of multiple GPUs. Firstly, you should really only be considering this if you’re planning on 4k, and more so if you’re futureproofing for any upcoming 4k 144Hz monitor you’re hoping to splurge on as and when they come out. For all other purposes, you’re advised to stick to a single powerful GPU by getting the best one you can afford. Why? Consider that SLI has very poor developer support, and when it does, you’re very, very unlikely to see 100% scaling and get 60FPS where you were getting 30FPS. Also considering Nvidia has over 70% of the GPU market share, I don’t need to elaborate on the brilliant developer support Crossfire enjoys. You would be much happier and face much less headaches and have much more fun and even save considerable dough with a single 1080 Ti rather than a pair of 1080s in SLI. But supposing you do want the 1080 Ti or even a Titan SLI setup because of the aforementioned 144Hz 4k or because you’re certified Enthusiast Number 1 with a wallet deeper than the Marina Trench, you may then want to consider a HEDT platform, as Ryzen and most chips around that price will support only a single PCI-E 3 lane running at x16. For example, SLI may be supported by Ryzen on X370 boards, but the two slots will run on x8/x8 mode. Intel will be similar, do check. While this would not have been an issue a couple years ago, with the advent of monsters such as the 1080 Ti and Titan cards and the equally monstrous high resolution, high refresh rate displays, there are noted instances of such a x8/x8 setup for SLI actually bottlenecking such cards. So, get a Threadripper and enjoy the 64 PCI-E lanes regardless of chip, or get a X299 based processor that supports the desired number of lanes, but don’t pick up X370 or similar Intel counterparts for SLI. As for Crossfire, if you’re intent on it, several B350 boards do support it, though again in a x8/x8 setup, though that may prove adequate for AMD cards. Point being: get either a single 1080 Ti, or if SLI’ing those or Titans, look at an HEDT rig and do it properly (and get a 1200W PSU to be absolutely safe).


You’ll likely have a similar situation with Intel boards. I’d just like to conclude this section by saying it’s hardly ever necessary to spend nearly $200 on a motherboard, when so many in the $90-$130 range are built so well and packed with adequately more than the essential features. Visit the manufacturers websites and take advantage of their comparison tools; do your own homework before you spend the extra amount just because you think you should, or because it’s the most popular thing to do.


**Considerations for CPU cooling:**


Another topic that gets a lot of attention, only some of which is justified according to me, is CPU cooling. Yes, it is important to keep the chip cool, but not as cool as possible. Why? Simply because there’s no need to spend the money there. Consider this, my R7 1700 at 3.7GHz reached 85 degrees during a Prime95 SmallFFT torture test while using its default 95W Spire cooler. That is indeed high, yet 10 degrees lower than the 95 degrees limit AMD prescribes for it, but here’s the kicker: it gets that hot in a scenario very unrepresentative of my regular use case. While gaming, it doesn’t exceed 65 degrees, a full 30 degrees below its 95 degree limit, even with the AORUS 1080Ti in my system radiating it’s heat upwards and towards it over prolonged gaming sessions. Yes, a better air cooler would knock it down by maybe 10-12 degrees, a water cooler by 15-25. But, why? The chip is far below it’s 95 degrees limit, and I cannot hear the fan. A loud fan is indeed a good reason to get a better cooler, if the noise from your fan bothers you, by all means go ahead and get one. If, however, the sound from the fan is not bothering you yet, save that money. The sound from the Wraith cooler on my older Phenom II X6 1090T really bothered me, and I simply solved it by swapping out that fan for a better one; a much cheaper, faster and easier solution rather than changing the whole thing!


If you really like the idea of an AIO liquid cooler, then go ahead, but I urge you to consider a 140mm radiator to save some dough. Yes, 280mm is better, but a 140mm radiator is already as good or slightly better than most good air coolers, and that’s really perfect enough. But more importantly, do consider that you’re adding another part to your rig that is candidate for an RMA: the pumps do fail, sometimes sooner than later, and worse: liquid leaks. Maybe it’s not as common, but it still happens: just recently I came across a post here on Reddit by a person whose Corsair H100i literally burst a pipe during operation and fried his motherboard and GTX 970. Also, when you are thinking of that sexy Kraken or H100i, consider that neither NZXT nor corsair are known for their world class customer service. Just be sure of your decision and think of it from many angles, is all I’d like to reiterate. Personally, I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night thinking of any CPU water cooling equipment, the Kraken or the H100i or whatever lingering right over my 1080 Ti, but that’s just me. You may differ.


One last thing: you may think you’re keeping your room cool in the summer by gaming with the CPU at just 35 degrees Celsius thanks to your 360mm radiator, but keep in mind that heat has got to go somewhere, and a better CPU or any component cooler is only considered better for its ability to dump more heat from the component that it is cooling into its surrounding environment. You may be running your chip cooler at the cost of a warmer zone around your PC, all for no added benefit to your CPU that’s already well below its thermal limit! 


**Considerations in choosing a power supply:**


This is the one component I advise you to splurge on. Get a great PSU, after all, it’s going to be delivering power to your components, do you really want to skimp on that?! As for wattage, you must decide based on your use case. If this is a rig you may even have a remote probability of upgrading in the future, get at least a good 650W PSU. That should be enough for a high-end processor and a 1080 Ti along with a good number of HDDs and SSDs. Were possible, getting a 700W or 750W PSU would not hurt so as to keep a little extra breathing room, though it may not be immediately essential. If you feel you may SLI or Crossfire in the future and have a rig with some watercooling and several drives, please do look at a 1200W PSU. If you’re beyond certain of a zero possibility of upgrading and are building a moderate system, even a 550W PSU should suffice: but never skimp on quality. If there is any chance that you may upgrade, think how much it would suck to have to buy a new PSU again at that time. Invest in this one, it’s a long-term call.


There are also PSUs with digital interfaces that let you monitor things via software, I do not think that’s very useful, but if you like the idea, get one. One thing: the PSUs by Corsair that have the digital interface have one feature over the standard ones I like: a PSU fan test switch. With many PSUs having a silent operation mode and keeping their fans off when the power draw is below a certain amount (350W on my 750W RMx, I believe), the fan stays off and sometimes one gets concerned that the fan is at least operational. A fan test switch is indeed useful here. Corsair has the RMi and HXi series, with the ‘i’ demarcating the digital interface. Other PSU brands will have something similar. Check on it.


**Considerations for storage:**


This one is relatively simpler, yet I messed up a bit here. Definitely get a 250GB SSD for the OS. I find this capacity adequate. Remember, I also use my system for work, and have several IDEs and Dev tools such as Visual Studio with several SDKs and even Unreal Engine installed on my C drive, along with Ghost Recon Wildlands, Elite Dangerous and Far Cry 4, and I still have 40GB free. Yes, I keep all documents, music and videos on the mass storage hard drive and not on the C drive, and if you aren’t already, get with the program and move your files off the C drive ASAP.


Where I messed up is the slightly small 275GB game drive SSD. Large games with huge textures benefit immensely from an SSD, and having a SSD to shove those games that should be on an SSD is a very worthy investment. It would be ideal for me to have a 1TB SSD for them and have them all in one place, this makes Windows reinstalls a lot easier as all the games are on one drive and need minimal setup. Alas, that’s out of my budget for now and the 275GB drive is simply a stop gap arrangement. Based on the games that you play and their size, get a separate SSD for them as and when you can afford to, it makes maintaining them far easier, especially when you are in that situation wherein a fresh Windows installation must be done. Use a large HDD for mass storage of documents and older games.


As for NVMe? I recently had a chat with a game developer who worked on Far Cry Primal and For Honor back when he was a Game Dev for Ubisoft and he’s currently running a Threadripper 1950X and two EVGA FTW3 1080 Tis in SLI on his private development rig which has no NVMe drives. He said the 0.5 second savings in load times is not worth it to him. Here’s a dude with no shortage of reasons and money for a fast rig of that stature, and he didn’t need a NVMe drive. I doubt most of us do either. Save the dough, unless you need the space savings or are getting one for very near the price of a regular SSD, just get the regular SSD. Spend the money on a better GPU and PSU, or go buy a gym membership and a box of whey protein and stop obsessively spending all this time here!


**Considerations in choosing RAM:**


16GB is regarded as a good amount today, more than adequate for today’s stuff and enough legroom for tomorrows awesomeness. If you cannot currently afford that much, get 8GB. Most processors run dual channel memory, and so for budget builds many will advise a 4GB x 2 configuration. I advise against this. Why? Maybe you can’t get 16GB now, but it will be essential soon and maybe you can add a second 8GB stick 6 months later. Keep it as future proof as possible, why get around to buying another 2 4GB sticks later and struggle if you encounter issues with this setup? You’ll encounter no initial issues with the single channel setup, and in the future when you get a dual channel setup, you won’t encounter any issues then either.


Do check compatibility well. Ryzen is known to really favor Samsung B-die, this has been confirmed by AMD themselves. Other chips may have similar preferences. Google memory support on your platform of choice before pulling the trigger to be sure. I got lucky and my LPX runs on XMP with no issues and even passed a night of MemTest. But don’t rely on chance and so please do a little research on this, you’ll save yourself of a colossal headache diagnosing issues that stem from memory that creates all sorts of instabilities and prevents a boot in the worst case.


As for RAM speeds, please don’t think spending an extra $100 on 3600MHz memory over 3000MHz memory will do you any wonders. Yes, you may score higher at benchmarks, but in any practical application, may actually see as little as a 2%-3% difference, that too when you’re lucky!


**Considerations in choosing a case:**


Go with what you need. Talk to yourself about what exactly are your requirements. I choose the S340 Elite because it’s the best looking compact ATX case, and there’s a fair chance I travel around and I would hate to have to check-in this rig on flights. With a case as compact as this, I can just take it as carry-on baggage. I spent a ton of time sitting on manufactures websites with a scale in my hand pouring over the dimensions of these cases as mentioned on their specification sheets. See what your requirements are and invest accordingly. Again, it would suck to have to buy a new case at a later date and to reassemble.


Maybe you hope to move onto Threadripper or X299 in the future. Then you’ll may need a case that can support the Extended ATX (E-ATX) size some of the boards of those platforms require. Assess your requirements thoroughly and invest once and invest well.


**Considerations in choosing a graphics card:**


Yes, finally. I know many of you were waiting on this one. So, there’s three ways I’d recommend to go about this: firstly, simple: get the fastest card you can currently afford. But what if it’s not that great a card/you desire more? What if you can “only” get a GTX 1080 now but you know a couple months later can get a 1080 Ti? That gets us to my second approach: if you need a working computer right away, get the cheapest card you can find. Maybe a reliable secondhand HD 7850 for $50. Maybe a GTX 1050 for $65 or a RX 550 or whatever. And hold it for a few months before getting a top of the line card.


But what if you don’t need a 1080Ti now, are sure you will not need it in the near future either and can get a 1060 or RX 570 or something and are completely okay with that? Maybe you are certain of sticking to 1080p@60Hz or similar. Then just get the best you can get, and be happy. Just make sure you’re really certain. It’s easy to convince yourself that you are content with your parts at the time you’re paying for them, but it is far easier to start craving for more once the gaming begins. Don’t let that be you. Be sure of your requirements, if you’re keen on jumping onto 144Hz or 1440p or even 1440p 144Hz or 4k but can’t afford a 1080 or 1080Ti now, maybe you can plan to spend on that a couple months down the line. It’s better to sacrifice today and get a small, cute little 1050 only to make a really nice jump a short bit later. 


This is also what I did. I bought a reference 4GB RX480 back in March, before the mining craze. Got it brand new from Newegg with Doom free and a $30 rebate for a final price of $160. Man, those were good times for GPUs…seems a long time back now. I sold that RX 480 slightly after the mining craze and moved on to this GTX 1080 Ti. Why didn’t I sell earlier? I was convinced on RX Vega and so blinded by it, I didn’t even consider this move. So, there is my final and most important point WRT GPU purchases: never, ever make plans on the basis of future releases. Even if the product is good, you may not get your hands on it at MSRP for months. If you can wait that out with your current build, then by all means do so. Otherwise, just get the best deal out there on the move you plan to make and get on with your life. 


When choosing between various high-end parts, just get the best priced one. I picked the AORUS 1080 Ti because it was the cheapest of all custom 1080 Tis at the time, I also knew it’s copper baseplate cooling was superior to many others, but I didn’t really bother verifying this. Price ruled. What difference are you expecting between an AORUS 1080Ti, and a MSI Gaming X or an ASUS Strix? They’re aftermarket cards from good brands and are definitely better than the Founders Edition, that’s really all that matters. If the Strix was cheaper, I’d have got that even though I liked the AORUS card’s look more. Doesn’t matter. These cards are also incredibly fast and overclocking them really won’t be worth your time and thought. Just stick with a good brand with good after sales support and get the cheapest amongst them without worry. Really think 20MHz or even 50MHz on a 1080 Ti will matter? Nvidia boost automatically takes my card up to 1984MHz, though Gigabyte claims just 1600MHz something on their website. All other cards will be the same, ditto for other chips. As long as you’re getting one with a good AIB custom cooler, just get the best priced model and move on.


**Considerations when choosing a monitor:**


Now this is a touchy topic. You may be confused with all the terminology out there, I was too. First thing first, for a gaming setup, I absolutely recommend a Freesync or a G-Sync panel depending on your graphics card being an AMD or a Nvidia card. Either ways, I absolutely recommend active refresh, and not for the screen tearing which didn’t personally bother me as much, though again you may be different, but instead for the removal of stutter from those times your framerate falls below the refresh rate of the monitor and for extending the life of your rig by providing a smooth gaming experience for a longer time. Let me share my own experience:


I initially had a RX 480 in my system with a 1080p 60Hz monitor. With a good mix of high and very-high settings coupled with anti-aliasing, it rarely ever kept to a smooth 60 FPS. I hated the stutter, and soon switched to my current ultrawide 75Hz monitor. Aware of the increase in resolution, I was certain I’d have to slash settings down even further on my system, but thanks to Freesync, I never ended up having to care. I did not reduce my quality settings in a single game, GTA V or Witcher 3 or Elite Dangerous as framerates down to low 50s felt butter smooth. Following the Vega fiasco, I ended up with a 1080 Ti. Now this card is amazing, no doubt at all. Where the RX 480 could not even run GTA V at a smooth 60 FPS with no MSAA and high settings, I get a smooth 75FPS with 4xMSAA and every setting maxed other than grass and the advanced stuff. I get the 140FPS I should in the GTA V benchmark, and 95FPS on the Ghost Recon benchmark with Very High settings. But let me tell you something, there are still times when the framerate drops. Not very frequently, but not so infrequently that I can just dismiss it. Sometimes, you’ll end up in that fucked up scenario in GTA V where you’re downtown and it is nighttime and there’s tons of reflection and shadow and a lot of cars and people and it rains and there’s fog and my framerate actually tanks to 50-55 FPS. In Ghost Recon, keeping Turf Effects on along with ultra shadows and vegetation leads to a smooth 60 FPS, and yet a good number of times it will drop to 45-50. The stutter sucks. I hate it. Enough to have scouted out a G-Sync ultrawide somehow. Look, the benchmarks you see in card reviews are great, and I too get those figures and the 100 FPS on Witcher 3 at ultra with 4x Hairworks and the 28000 points on Fire Strike, but real-life gaming is not represented well by these benchmarks. There will be moments that bring even really powerful systems down, and the bigger problem: not all games are optimized well. Case in point, Far Cry 4 hates Ryzen in my experience, and Firewatch and Euro Truck Sim 2 aren’t the best optimized games either. No matter how fast your processor with how many cores and how expensive your GPU, not every game will run at those incredible framerates, at least not all the time, and not even the ones that benchmark really well. Active refresh technologies like G-Sync and Freesync are a very essential part of a gaming rig in my humble opinion.


Now you may have heard of LFC, or Low Framerate Compensation on monitors. Yes, this is another worthy feature. What does it do? Briefly put, if there are times your framerate falls really low, below the minimum boundary of the Freesync or G-Sync range, it’ll automatically display each frame twice so as effectively double the framerate and thus push it back into the Free/G sync range. So 20 FPS moments turn to 40 FPS. Again, a great feature to have. While only some Freesync panels have this, all G-Sync panels do. Keep in mind the new Freesync 2 certification from AMD requires all Freesync 2 panels to have this feature. G-Sync panels also have a feature called Ultra Low Motion Blur, or ULMB, which aims to combat the excessive blurring you may encounter when the framerates and refresh rates are so high that the monitors response time slows down to several milliseconds. Again briefly put, it aims to strobe the backlight in sync with the refresh rate, but here’s the caveat: G-Sync must be off for it to take effect, and its generally effective at the 85+ FPS range. As G-Sync is often a better feature to have enabled, don’t overpay for a monitor that claims to have a superior implementation of ULMB.


Now, for the very touchy topic of pixel density, or more so, the lack of it. Many will claim they absolutely need ‘x’ dpi, but really most of us will not notice. I’ve gamed on PS4’s hooked to 1080p 50” displays that looked fantastic, and using a 2560x1080 34” ultrawide has been a gorgeous experience. Yes, the extra screen space obtained for productivity from a 3440x1440 panel may be nicer, but you know what’s better? Not having extra space in my wallet due the $400-$600 extra I didn’t spend on the low refresh rate 1440p ultrawide panel. I was almost sold on them, and was reading reviews for the Acer X34, when on the conclusion page despite awarding it the “Editor Recommended” batch, Tom’s hardware felt compelled to mention how you shouldn’t dismiss the Z35 just for its lower resolution as its brilliant panel makes this a non-issue. Heading over to the conclusion page for the Z35 review, they call it “the most beautiful display that has graced our labs”. Now I doubt Acer would pay to show the Z35 over the X34, so I believe they’re being honest, and if they can feel that after testing all those displays, you should reconsider your worry on “pixel density”. Nonetheless, I did manage to check them both out in person and was really glad Tom’s said that as they were absolutely right: I found no reason to pay that much extra from the X34 1440p display. I program, work and game on a 2560x1080 display, and am only thrilled each time. Don’t believe people on the internet who profess their necessity for high pixel densities and thank God for having spent on it: it’s the internet, there’s a very good chance they’re either just trying to get themselves to feel better for having spent that extra amount or are image/video professionals who for some reason feel the need to state why they need it when it’s obvious to us all that they do. Some will be nice and honest too. 34 inches is not “too much” for 2560x1080, but those many extra hundreds of dollars might be too much for you. Don’t let this deprive you of the experience an ultrawide monitor can get you, and do think twice and try to check them out in person always.

Also, an added bonus, many 2560x1080 panels including the Z35 have a very high refresh rate along the lines of 165-200 Hz. So, the 1080 Ti might be rendering to a slightly lower resolution screen but really gets to stretch its legs with that refresh range on a G-Sync panel. Also, the 1080 Ti in my system just got more future proof thanks to this. See why I say don’t dismiss things easy?!


Lastly, would I recommend an ultrawide display? Absolutely. Again, a game changing and exhilarating experience not only the first time you play, but each time. And full screen modern movies. What’s not to love?


**All this finally leads us to our conclusions:**


**Conclusions:**


1.	Buy the fasted factory-clocked chip you can, overclock only when necessary, or if you have the time and patience to learn to do it right. You can also spend on a CPU in stages, say if you’re building a system today on a limited budget and hope to upgrade in the future, get a good motherboard and PSU and a Ryzen 1400 or 1500X. That’s adequate for now, and then around 18 months later when 2nd gen Ryzen is out, get the top notch 6 or 8 core model then. With intel, your choices in this regard may be limited as they always have so many motherboard sockets. Maybe you can get an i3/i5 now and get an i7 from the same generation later on from the secondhand market.
2.	With motherboards, more expensive is hardly ever necessary. Look for a solid board in the $90-$130 range, it’ll probably have more than enough I/O, connectivity and PCI-E lanes for you. Then again, if going the X299 or X399 route, go all out and get the beefiest, fanciest board you can: you’re not upgrading for ages and no point getting onto the HEDT bandwagon and compromising even a single feature thanks to the board. And surely, going this route, you can afford it!
3.	Check RAM compatibility on your platform. For a gaming system, if not going with 16GB today, get a single 8GB stick and upgrade by adding another one later so as to get them on dual channel mode. Don’t think you’re going to get a world of difference by splurging on 3600MHz memory over 2600MHz one. The real-world performance difference is negligible, if you’re lucky, you may see a couple extra frames. Also do keep in mind that with Ryzen, any RAM speed above 3200MHz depends on silicon lottery as RAM speeds directly correlate to the speed of the Infinity Fabric in the chip. You may splurge to get the highest speed RAM kit but may have no luck running it!
4.	Splurge on a solid PSU. If you’re definitely not upgrading, just get what you need for your current build and be done with it. Otherwise, get as much breathing space as possible. If you may go with SLI/Crossfire in the future and may have watercooling pumps and radiators and several drives, get at least a 1200W PSU.
5.	A 250GB SSD for the OS and applications should be more than adequate. Try to get a separate SSD for the games, it is definitely worth it for the newer, larger titles, and be sure to add a mass storage hard drive.
6.	Get a case that suits your needs. If you’ll be travelling, get a compact one. If you’ll be upgrading to an E-ATX based platform like Threadripper or X299, get a case that’ll accommodate them when it’s time.
7.	Don’t get talked into the pixel density argument WRT monitors. Try them out yourself, but don’t over splurge beyond your means. Definitely try your best to score Free/G sync, and do consider ultrawide displays. A 29-inch ultrawide is as tall as a 24” 16:9 monitor and a 34” one is as tall as a 27” 16:9 display. Keep that in mind when choosing, and try to get a large one, especially if you’re paying extra for G-Sync, as you may not upgrade soon.
8.	Don’t obsess with running your CPU as cool as possible, it’s unnecessary as long as it’s running well within thermal range and keep in mind that all that excess CPU cooling will just dump more heat into the surrounding, thus creating a warmer atmosphere for you around your PC for no added benefit to the chip. Think also of the higher risk of pump failure and liquid leakage and the RMA hassles before you invest in watercooling. With custom cooling loops, think of the fuss each time you need to move anything inside, what with draining the reservoir and everything, do your research beforehand and be sure you’re ready for all this.
9.	Lastly, along with Googling your doubts and asking them here and on other forums, spend time on the manufactures websites. They often have great comparison tools and detailed specs. Make use of that and of your own reasoning, don’t blinded accept anything you’re told without researching this way yourself, and putting your own thought into it.


**Some general things to keep in mind when building:**


1.	If your PSU has those daisy-chain 8 pin connectors for the GPU in a (6+2) + (6+2) config, for high powered cards that have two 8-pin power slots, use two different cables instead of daisy chaining. Remember the following:


6 pin = 75 watts


6+2 = 8 pin = 150 watts


So using:


8 pin is okay


6+2 is okay


6+6 to a single 8 pin is okay


But,


8+8 in one cable via daisy chaining is not


6+2 + 6+2 in one cable via daisy chaining is not and


6+2 + 6 via daisy chaining is not


2.	Be sure to plug in RAM in the right slots. In my motherboard, the RAM acted very funny and never enabled XMP when I’d accidently left them in the black slots numbered 2 and 4. I moved them to the red slots numbered 1 and 3 and all has been good since. Your board may have such a need too. Check the manual.
3.	Run MemTest once overnight on newly installed RAM with XMP enabled.
4.	Don’t forget to enable XMP in the BIOS! This has to be done manually!
5.	Update the BIOS only when needed, when there is a feature that’s missing in your current BIOS or a bug that’s affecting you and you need it fixed, do not unnecessarily upgrade if all is well. Follow the old American adage: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!
6.	Enabling a global frame rate limit in Radeon Settings or the Nvidia Control Panel when you’re running Free/G sync may prevent some games from running in full screen mode. I had this problem when I had used Radeon settings and set the Global Frame Rate Target Control setting to 74 FPS, it made the display hang when trying full screen with Elite Dangerous and Far Cry 4. Disabling this setting fixed it, this was an accidental discovery I made that had me scratching my head for a long time wondering what’s wrong and I do hope this helps out someone in a similar situation.
7.	Lastly, when enabling a frame rate limit such as above, set it to one below the max refresh rate of the monitor, so 143 FPS for a 144Hz panel.


And with that we’re done with this humongous post, congratulations and thank you for having gone through it! I hope this helped you in some way, and do feel free to reach out with any questions/suggestions you may have. Wish you the very best ahead!


**LINUX:**
Do NOT get ANY Gigabyte AM4 motherboard if you're planning on using anything Linux. Kernels newer than 4.10 will encounter a panic on boot, displaying ""unexpected IRQ trap at vector 07"". This'll need you to boot with ACPI off. Fedora 24 and Linux Mint 18 are stable though.

Hello all!  Some of you may remember my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7i9mja/bf_put_a_ring_on_it_but_put_off_building_a_pc/?st=jc144vqv&sh=1181c699) a few weeks back asking for build help.  I thought some of you may want an update and I have a very happy one!  He did propose on Xmas and of course I said yes!  Fiancé promptly started building his new pc after opening his gifts :).

Here is his final build: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/vddZnn
(He's using storage from his previous computer.)

I took a couple pictures for you guys.  The [first picture](https://imgur.com/WZHwfDC) is of -and please let a girl indulge - the ring (it's a morganite stone, for those very few who are curious) with him working on the computer in the background.  Yes, that's our corgi 'helping', I know these aren't the best conditions for putting together parts, but everything turned out great and the dog insists on being in on the action.

The [second picture](https://imgur.com/FgRVo6t) is of the ""final"" build.  Fiancé wants to possibly add more RGB ram, more lighting in general, more fans, possibly a fancier CPU cooler, etc to complete the 'look' but it's basically done!  We invited a couple friends from out of town for New Years and spent almost the entire weekend gaming together.  Fiancé had a blast doing it on his new rig!  He's tested out his favorites (Dark Souls 3, Witcher 3..) and he's blown away by the new graphics and performance.  Our friends now want to build their own rigs, imagine that!

So in closing, thank you so much to this community for your help!  We are so happy, he loves his new computer and you guys are awesome for helping in making this all work out so wonderfully. "
buildapc,"DISCLAIMER: I CLEARLY didn’t express this well enough in my post, so I’m putting it here. This post is NOT a rant. I’m happy and grateful for what she’s doing, it’s just a little irritating. I’m just curious if anyone else has had the same experience.

Hey! I was curious if anyone else has the same “problem” that I have (it’s not really a problem, I know she’s just proud of me but it’s kinda annoying) where my mother has been telling EVERYONE she knows that her son built a pc all by himself. Whenever we meet up with family that I haven’t seen for a bit, the first thing she says is “Christian built a pc, you know.” I’m curious if anyone else has had the same or a similar circumstance to this."

I posted something here about this awhile ago but now it’s finally finished. Basically, I built a literal toaster PC.

Also, I still need a name for it if anyone can think of anything.

Hope you guys like it!


EDIT: 
Wow, thanks everyone for all the nice comments I’m glad people like this so much. I never posted the specs so here they are:

- ASUS ROG Strix x-470
- AMD Ryzen 7 2700x
- Zotac GeForce 1080ti Mini
- 32Gb Corsair DDR4 Vengeance RGB Pro, 3200mhz
- Corsair H100i Pro RGB AIO

I haven’t done any benchmarking yet but the temps don’t seem too bad and air flow is decent throughout the case. I might make an update post in the future with benchmarks once I find a way to fit in that CD Drive I had to take out and another SSD, right now it’s just the 480Gb M.2 on the motherboard."

buildapc,"Due to a kernel memory vulnerability in Intel CPU's over the past decade, a patch is required. Unfortunately intel cannot fix this via micocode so all operating systems (windows, Linux, Mac os, etc) will need patches. These patches will give a 5-30% performance hit depending on the task and the CPU model. 

If you're planning on buying an Intel system, I would recommend waiting for the patches to come out to see how bad it is. I doubt intel will lose their gaming lead, but it is possible.

AMD will not be affected by this issue as their architecture does not have this vulnerability. So if you have an amd system you have no need to be worried.

Brilliant ""explain this to me like I'm 5"" [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/_/ds2x83j) by /u/name_censored_ in /r/sysadmin

> Computer hides your treasure from the bad man. The bad man shakes the boxes to find your treasure. Computer has to spend more time hiding the treasure. Computer is slow now :(

**EDIT: I want to point out, that the ""<=30%"" claim is for people mostly running vm's. For your average task the issue will be closer to 5%. So don't feel like you made a huge mistake in your intel purchase. But like I said before, wait for some benchmarks before you draw a conclusion. Some things may be affected and some might not.**

Adding to this, it's a very new bug (as in, it's just recently been found) so nothing is in concrete at the moment. Expect things to change as time goes on. And just like the ryzen segmentation bug it's most likely blown out of proportion.

**UPDATE: Some benchmarks have been released in windows. With an 3960x and a 1080 Ti at 1080p there was a 2-4% drop in performance. With dx12/Vulcan games taking the biggest hit. I'm guessing the 8700k is the best off. It would be interesting to see some benchmarks of pre-haswell systems without pcid and some post haswell. But I think it's safe to say for gaming the hit is very little for the 8700k.**

**If any of you would like to build a database of benchmarks with pre and post patches (the patch is is in latest windows insider build) please do. The more information we have about this the better.**

More information can be found here: https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/prozessoren/45319-intel-kaempft-mit-schwerer-sicherheitsluecke-im-prozessor-design.html

**UPDATE 2: Both intel and amd have this issue, but and is not affected with the ""meltdown"" bug which is the one with the performance hit.**

You can read more here in this table created by /u/nostraaugusta: https://i.imgur.com/RXVJl8j.jpg

As we know already the 8700k is basically not affected, the performance difference is miniscule. But someone has done some benchmarks with a 4690k, which on average has around a 5% drop. Ranging from 1.5% to 13% here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/7o2ctw I would like to add to this, every CPU is acting differently on pretty much every game. Do not take this 4690k result as the same for every Benchmark. **Every CPU is different**"

Like no we’re not “saving $30” for a used ryzen, the part is used mate, you can’t compare it to retail price. 

I’ve been seeing used 1080s or cards that have been mined on go for just a little under their retail price on the used market. 

Just infuriates me sometimes"
buildapc,"I just thought it would be fun to share our ""war stories"" as a community to show those new builders afraid to make mistakes that it's okay. We all screw up from time to time. 99% of the time when you make a mistake, all you harm is your ego. I've built around a dozen pcs for reference, here's mine;

About two months ago I did a brand new build for myself. It was quite the upgrade from fx-8350 and rx580 to R52600 and 5600xt. Newegg had lost my CPU and it took five weeks before I finally received it. As you can imagine I was in a hurry to get up and running and dig into some Red Dead Redemption 2. I get the build together, it fires up first try except just one problem. There is no video output. I troubleshoot everything, eventually rebuilding the entire thing. Still nothing. The PC is turning on but I have no video. I spend 4 hours trying to figure out what the issue is when finally I swap in the rx580 and that's when I realize. I had been plugging the HDMI cable into the motherboard...

She runs great now and I couldn't be happier with it.

Edit: Some of the stories involving thermal paste have me wondering about you guys :)"
buildapc,"I've been in IT for a long time. I've moved into the enterprise space, working mostly for larger companies.  I'll freely admit that this has left me jaded, and, frankly, has nearly killed the joy I found on the hobbyist side of computers.

After a long day in the trenches, trudging through data centers and meeting with clients, the last thing I want to do is work on a computer. I just feel like I've been there, done that. The joy was gone.

Hell, I don't even personally own a PC. With the exception of a phone, anything I use is either company or family owned.

I even game (gasp) on a freaking console.

But that recently changed. My 14 year old son asked me to help him build a gaming PC.

**Holy shit,** this has been amazing. We talked about what he wanted to play (Minecraft, Space Engineers, Titanfall 2 and Apex). We researched Cases, CPUs, video cards, motherboards and RAM. We looked at benchmarks, bad YouTube videos, and read reviews.

We spent tons of time together where I wasn't just dumb ol' dad.

So, after us planning, he started saving, doing extra chores, and working odd jobs for the neighbors, he finally had enough to get his system. He handed me the money, and told me to order the parts.

Things came in over the course of several days, and we spent the evenings putting his ""beast"" together. My job was to point and explain. We got it all together, and he asked me to show him how to clean up the cables. Velcro and zip-ties were our friend.

We had some issues with the motherboard BIOS version and the CPU, but AMD came through with a CPU kit. The best part is that he learned some basic troubleshooting and how to write to vendors.

We finally finished putting it together, installed the OS and such, and then tried a few games.

Honestly, this was the best time I've had putting a machine together ***ever***. Even my own gaming rigs weren't this much fun.

I forgot why I loved this field. My son just helped me remember. I can't thank him enough.

buildapc,"I had built a PC for personal use in 2016 which included a 750ti. The PC was built for light gaming & internet browsing, so I never noticed the difference. Today, I found out that the monitor was plugged into the Mobo. Period. "
buildapc,"I recently upgraded to a new Ryzen build and I am loving it! But the purpose of this post isn't about that. The purpose of this post is to inform users that use Mobile Broadband USB dongles, or any other Usb Modem that the windows 10 Creators update breaks **Some** older style modems.

When I fresh installed windows 10 I didn't realize that I downloaded the creators update ISO. This lead to a week and a half of me writing on windows message boards and searching the internet for anyone that had this same problem. When trying to dial out with the Usb modem in my case the Mc760 from Virgin Mobile, it came back with error 633 in windows and  the message ""The remote computer did not respond please try again.

I followed the standard troubleshooting steps of updating all drivers, uninstall and reinstall, try on a different computer. None of these steps worked.

From my research there are a couple cases of people having this problem all buried deep in discussion boards and Microsoft help forums. As far as I can tell Microsoft hasn't officially said this problem exist and the response that I got from there support staff was contact the manufacturer for updated drivers.

There is a shining light tho. After a week of trying to fix this problem, I found out you can still download Windows 10 Anniversary update ISO's from Microsoft if you access there site from a non windows device, saying you are going to install it on a mac since Macs are having problems with the Creators update instillation. Microsoft has kept this Older ISO download active just buried Deep with in there site.

**The Big Point**

Be Careful when updating to creators update from Microsoft if you use a USB Dongle for internet. I was lucky and found a way to download another ISO but that strategy might not always work.

**Edit:** The Problem appears to be fixed, while a Temporary fix has been out for about a month [Here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/dial-up-error-633-winstall-of-build-15063/2c5b280e-e246-4105-b8e6-58e413d2668e?tm=1491426971838) Microsoft has released [KB4022716](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4022716/windows-10-update-kb4022716) which claims to ""Addressed issue where, after upgrading to Windows 10 RS2, modem dial-up fails with Error 633.  "" I am glad that this problem was actually fixed and not thrown to the side."
buildapc, Ok so I'm sorry if this is common knowledge but i just found this out yesterday and thought i would share just in case it would help someone else... So I have a 2080 and wasn't really impressed with my performance on channels like jaystwocents and LTT said that playing siege on 1440p you should be expecting around 120 fps and i was barely getting 70 with 1080p. I was a bit stumped as to why but then I went into NVIDIA control panel Manage 3D settings > DSR - factors which is what resolution your gpu is making then it down scales it to your monitors resolution and mine was set to 3 times my monitors resolution I turned it down to 1.2 times and set the settings in siege to do the same now I'm getting 200 fps just a psa I feel kinda dumb now that I found it but oh well. So if your experiencing lackluster performance from your high end card take a look at this. 
buildapc,"This is something we're seeing coming up again recently with the Nvidia and Intel product launches.  
  
You cannot forget that it is the responsibility of a company to earn your money by producing a product worthy of the purchase. Preordering is something we're having huge problems with in the video game industry, and it's starting to spread its sickly tentacles into hardware.  
  
The entire concept of preordering is anti-consumer. By doing so, you're surrendering your agency to a corporation that has no loyalty to anything except for profit. When companies can get your money before they've demonstrated that their product is worth purchasing, they have no motivation to make the best product they can.  
  
Never Preorder.  
  
EDIT: Alright, RIP the inbox, this blew up, yada yada. To all the people commenting that ""you're allowed to spend your money however you like"", I agree with you. You are allowed to. But you [shouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y). And there's a [ton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7zxKMSSM4U&t=15s) of [information](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/stop-pre-ordering-video-games/) out there produced by [smarter](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3og4bo/eli5_why_preordering_is_bad/) people than myself who can [explain](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/reasons-not-preorder-video-games.html/) why better than I [can.](https://www.polygon.com/2016/6/12/11913998/e3-pre-orders-exclusive-beta-dont-do-it) [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/9msryq/just_a_reminder_never_preorder/) was originally made in reference to [Intel's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1mJMI_uaa8) intentionally [misleading](https://www.techspot.com/article/1722-misleading-core-i9-9900k-benchmarks/) benchmarks that they released during their embargo on [independent reviewers](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/278526-the-core-i9-gaming-benchmarks-intel-commissioned-against-amd-are-a-flat-lie), so that their results couldn't be [refuted](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3311827/computers/never-preorder-why-jumping-on-new-technology-before-its-tested-is-a-bad-idea.html). And I don't need to remind anyone of the RTX fiasco.  
  
Most people have assumed I was referring to games specifically. And that's fine, because game preorders are a huge problem too. I have strong opinions on the subject, because I believe that [games matter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg), and that the medium deserves to be a respected art form. But hype is no substitute for quality. Knowing that you're going to buy a game no matter what is fine, that's a personal decision. Preordering the game and helping provide the developer with a data point that says ""X% of the projected audience of this product will purchase it based on our promises alone"" is madness. Maybe it's good for you as an individual, because you get your shitty skin or whatever. But it's not good for the industry. And don't even get me started on actual gameplay-enhancing pre-order bonuses, or even worse, ""early access"". It's manipulative marketing at it's best, and we, as a consumer base, shouldn't stand for it.  
  
But by all means, keep calling me names and explaining why I'm a fascist idiot. "
buildapc,"Here I am building my first PC and I decided to put in my cpu (Ryzen 7 3700x) and it all goals fairly well yada yada and I put my heat sink on top of it and it looks beautiful. 

My OCD kicks in and i think to myself “hmmm it could be more straight” 

I proceed to yank the heat sink off and notice that on the bottom of my heat sink is my cpu. I basically broke every single pin 😂 

Live and learn my friends."
buildapc,"Hi everyone,

My son has been asking for a gaming PC, his very first one, months ago.
I told him that he'll have to earn it by working hard at school, nothing's free right ?
Well he did and got excellent results, way beyond my expectations !

Xmas 2019 is coming, so he asked for it again. Problem: I couldn't save enough money for him and told him to give me some time and maybe he will get it for his birthday on April 2020 :(
Here in France, PC parts cost a kidney.
He wasn't upset at all, he's a good kid and he knows that we get rewarded for our daily actions.
We parents always do our best for our kids. I didn't want him to think that he worked hard in vain.
So I sold my entire superheroes DC Comics collection figures ( sayonara Superman ) and got the money for him, he doesn't know this, that's our secret !

I was aiming for a mid end and future proof gaming PC, so that he won't be frustrated for the few upcoming years. Kids grow up fast, he's already 14 and time flies fast. Maybe he'll leave the house in 3 or 4 years to go to college.
I remembered being broke as a student and I just wanted him to have a decent and yet upgradable PC, replacing one or two parts such as a GPU or CPU is easier than changing the whole PC , isn't it ?

So I got all the parts and built in secret a mini itx PC, again so that is easier to carry and store in a student dorm room.
Some people only think as far as tomorrow, I think years ahead.

Building in that NZXT H210 case was very easy thanks to its size. I went on a pink and blue theme since those are his favorite colors.

- I decided to go red with a Ryzen 3700x, since he's very interested in video editing and rendering and some other stuffs that might require a powerful CPU.
- The Enermax Aquafusion 120 AIO cools down that beast and does a better job than the Prims cooler ( which was already decent ) that comes with the CPU.
- Then a RX 5700 XT should be more than enough to play on a wide QHD monitor ( couldn't buy it yet, have to save money, he'll play on a TV temporary ). The Sapphire Nitro Plus version seems to be a good choice, good temps, silent and wow beautiful ! It fits really tight but it FITS :)
- The Trident Z neo 3600 mhz RAM are here to let the Ryzen 3700x fully express itself.
- For the OS i went on a SSD m.2 Corsair MP 510 500 gb, should be enough to handle Windows 10 and all his softwares.
- Two SanDisk SSD Ultra 3 D 1tb and he has plenty of room for his games and other things that I don't want to know.
- A SF 750 Watts power supply from Corsair to deliver some juice and help the GPU to breathe.
- Added a few Enermax white case fans with beautiful RGB to highlight the components without going overkill.
- With great power comes the Gigabyte Aorus x570i pro wifi that has great responsibility to support all these.
- And to complete, a 5 inch screen to monitor the PC, yes he has to learn to keep an eye on the temps, CPU and GPU load, fan speed etc.

And here is Sans ( referring to one of his favorite game character from Undertale ) the Mini ITX PC in all its Glory.

https://fr.pcpartpicker.com/b/BMLJ7P


Christmas is coming in a few days, can't wait to offer him his dream PC. He has no idea what is waiting for him around the corner.
I hadn't half the chance that he has now when I was a kid, keep working hard, keep being nice, caring about the others, sharing and helping and you'll be rewarded, if I can see this, hopefully somebody else one day will do too and again you'll get REWARDED and I promise: you won't have to hunt for happiness.

Love you son.

Daddy

Sending positive vibes to all the fathers and mothers out there and wishing the best to everyone for the end of the year and the new upcoming year.

Edit:


Finally it's done 100 %, was missing the 5 inch screen , I've run many benchmarks to test it out and so far no issue.
Temps are amazingly good thanks to my cable management, CPU idle 29°c and full load 61°C
As for the GPU full load never exceed 69 °C

buildapc,"I have always ignored the ""get an ssd for your pc"" comments and decided to stick to my HDD drives mostly due to the larger capacities.I recently caved and bought a crucial 256 gig as a boot drive.

buildapc,"If I buy a used PSU and it fails within it's 10 year warranty can I send it in or would I need original proof of purchase?

EDIT: After reading through most of the major factories info they say warranty is not transferable. 

Also buying a PSU right now sucks ass. I just need this and a nice M.2 and I can get to building. RIP

EDIT: Ok thanks whoever did that. But god damn it!

EDIT: I don't even know what's going on here anymore but I love you all.

EDIT: Last one. I really thought it was a dumb question that's why I put ""don't upvote"". But thanks to everyone for their advice and this thing actually turned into something fun ass well as informative. Thanks for the awards. You all are great and I love this community!

Give or take a few hundred dollars and its still a massive savings.

Savings anywhere from $600 to as much as $2300.

You could build a top tier computer for the amount of money you would save.


I've always known this, and tell people not to buy prebuilts. But this is the first time I actually did the numbers out...and its gross.

EDIT: Let me add, prebuilts work out for some people who have no desire to build. But do your research and make sure your not overpaying by **two thousand dollars**

EDIT: Good god this blew up. In summary. Some prebuilts are great, Alienware prebuilts generally are not, if you pay attention to what you are buying you will be okay. I get it, **there are some great prebuilt PCs**"

Time to go play some games!"
buildapc,I've been thinking about this and have yet to come to a solid answer.
buildapc,"I can’t stop buying things for it now. Holy shit. Like I went with a budget power supply because I didn’t need anything fancy, but the yellow and black cables don’t match my case so now I need to get black and white extension cables. But if I do that then I need to get some LED fans so you can see the cable colors. Oh crap if I get LED fans you’ll be able to see the blue SATA cable hooked up to my SSD, time to get some black cables. Crap, my SSDs have their logo facing out and they don’t match, time to get an SSD case for them. Well now I have LED fans but my CPU fan isn’t LED, well I can’t have that, gotta get rid of that now too. 


Good lord. I shouldn’t have ever gone down this rabbit hole of love.

Edit: wow some of y’all are assholes and can’t stand a little sarcastic humor. I’m not OCD and freaking out about my computer. I play at 1080p 60hz, and I get perfect frame rates and resolutions on all the games I want to play. I just didn’t know how much I would not only enjoy building a computer but how much I wanted to work on it aesthetically as well as performance."
buildapc,"**tl;dr:** I built a hexagonal case out of Lego, has 3500 pieces, 32L, decent thermals. Super proud of it, wanted to share it :)

I've always been fascinated by hexagonal designs on stuff, and decided to rebuild my current Lego computer case into a full hexagonal shape. Took me about 3500 pieces and 200 hours, and I finally finished it!

And of course, it was made out of **100% Lego** \- no adhesives, glue, or any non-Lego parts.

**Pics:**

[Lego Computer](https://imgur.com/a/CFbz0xz)

The hardware is same as my old build so I won't post it here (see my [older post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5cjap6/built_my_own_lego_computer/)).

Case is 32L, which I think is very compact for a ATX case.

&#x200B;

**Thermals** are 65-72 Celsius while under max stress (Prime95), and GPU at 72-81 Celsius (3DMark). While gaming the GPU never exceeds 60C. I have three 120mm fans at the bottom pulling air into the case, and a 200mm fan at the top pulling the exhaust out.

&#x200B;

**Cost** of all parts are around $400, I don't have a proper estimate as I built it from dismantling my previous case, and that already didn't have a proper estimate since I bought a lot of pieces in bulk and had a lot left over.

&#x200B;

I've been planning this build for a while, mostly as an improvement over my old build. There's three main gripes about my old build that I wanted to improve upon:

* Having a vertically aligned (I/Os facing down) case means I have to lift up my PC every time I needed to plug things in.
* Having everything built in one piece and encasing the motherboard means I have to dismantle parts of the computer to access the hardware if I want to replace anything.
* It's huge. It was about 44L. I've been very into sffpcs for a while, and while I have an ATX board, I wanted to see how small I can make it while keeping decent thermals and sticking to a hexagonal build (because rectangular is boring).

Now there's a door that swings open for me to swap parts, and certain panels on the case can also be removed to access the SATA/other ports.

&#x200B;

[Here's my build process](https://imgur.com/a/QngUZQX)

Edit: Made the thermals portion more visible since most of the comments were asking about it, and adding how much it costs (a lot) :("

buildapc,"I've wanted to design and build my very own Lego Computer for a long time, and so 9 weeks and 5000 Lego pieces later, I finally finished it!

[Lego Computer](http://imgur.com/a/1AH2B)

&nbsp;

**My build has the following inside:**

Asus Z170-A

Core i7-6700K

Samsung EVO 850 1TB

EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 SC GAMING ACX 3.0 Black Edition

EVGA SuperNOVA 650 G2

Kingston HyperX FURY 16GB

&nbsp;

The parts (including the peripherals such as a Wi-Fi card) totalled ~$1.4k, the case was about $500. 


&nbsp;

On the thermals, the CPU runs at around 60-70 Celsius while under max stress (Prime95), and GPU at 70-80 Celsius (3DMark). The ambient temperature in the case from the two stress tests goes to about 50 Celsius. When playing games at top settings, the temperatures rarely go anywhere near those numbers. Plus I spread the heat sources (PSU, CPU, GPU) around the case, with each of the three fans blowing air across them. 


&nbsp;

EDIT:
I have another album where I took pictures of the progress. I didn't detail some parts of it because I got so engrossed with the construction that I forgot. :P

Also, I didn't use glue or any adhesive at all, looking at all the comments below. Just all Lego and PC hardware.

Son needs Intel Core i7-950 3.06 GHz, otherwise not sure..

Hi Master. Please forgive my ignorance to this subject. My son and I are very close, and for his upcoming birthday I want to gift him something that he really wants: a new PC (self build) that can run a few games such as, Counter Strike Go!, and Grand Theft Autos. He is also a musician and needs to run the pro tools. He doesn't know i'm buying this, but he has made it clear he really needs the following processor =Intel Core i7-950 3.06 GHz in order to run the pro tools well. Can someone please help me find parts that will run well with this processor? I'm looking to spend about $600-650 in total. Again I am sorry if this information isn't accurate, I am an older woman with no real experience doing this, but want to make my son's birthday special. Thanks masters!

buildapc,"Hey builders!

Effective immediately, I will no longer be on the mod team here at /r/buildapc. As we speak, I am packing up for the 25+ hour drive to Texas tomorrow. Why? I am fortunate enough to say that I have taken a job at [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com/), helping /u/manirelli with his duties and working on some new functionality you guys will really like. 

I've been hanging around /r/buildapc since it was a few months old (5 years ago!). In my time moderating, I believe I'm more qualified than anyone else to say that despite growing to quite a large size for such a niche subreddit, the community has been fantastic.

The rare occasions someone has asked me what it's like moderating /r/buildapc, the first thing I've always said was that you guys make it *easy*. While there are always some bad eggs, the vast majority of you have been a pleasure to work with. Everyone looks out for each other and for us as a mod team. We really have been fortunate to have the community's support in such an ample manner all these years.

Please do keep contributing to the subreddit. Please do keep maintaining respectful interactions with the humans on the other side of the keyboard. And please do keep making /r/buildapc a pleasure to moderate. While I think /r/buildapc has one of the best mod teams out there, both for mods and for users, an important part of that has been having one of the best communities.

I'm super excited for this next phase of my life; I'm glad I got to take this ride with you guys. You can bet I'll still be around the subreddit, and you can always reach me on [our IRC channel](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/irc).

Be excellent to each other,

buildapc,"Letter [here](https://imgur.com/a/l6C9Mi2).

Really wanting to help this kid with at least one part.

Edit for those thinking it's a con:  My wife's first reaction was the same and I firmly believe a dose of skepticism is healthy.  So let's assume worst case scenario it's a scam and I buy this kid (adult?) a part or two.  I've contributed to something that I believe to be an admirable cause-a kid looking to get into PC-building and tinkering.   A kid who wants to BUILD something themselves rather than buy it and have the work done for them.  A kid who clearly isn't asking for top of the line shit and just wants parts to build a damn PC.  

If it goes to an adult instead, then well, I've still done a good thing with admirable intentions and if that's how someone scams me out of $30 or so dollars, then so be it, I guess.  But fuck that person and may karma rain down upon them.

If you think it's a scam by me, please, by all means have a look at my post history."
buildapc,"I'm 16, in high school so I've met a few people that have built pcs, like I have. When we've talked about it though, and I describe my build to them (R3 1200, GTX 960 4gb, 8gb 3000 ram), they immediately seem dismissive of it just because it's cheaper than the i7s and SLI 1080s they have. 

I searched for parts for about 6 months, on a fixed budget of 550$. I don't have a job then and that was Christmas + birthday money saved. I ended up buying almost half of my parts used and ended up with something I'm very happy with (totalling ~$750 USD new). 

Now I have a job and will upgrade soon after I get a car but until then I will just get the same response from other PCMR members, I guess.

Edit 2: why TF did this blow up lol? I've gotten a few comments saying this is just a ploy to 'ask for free parts' or something. Again, this wasn't my intention, but if you really want to for some reason..."
buildapc,"It's getting scary. I'm seeing more and more people bringing up CPUboss comparisons, and it scares me to think some could make a purchase based off their results. I had some poor guy thinking a 3230m was better than an i3-6100 😣 
http://hwbench.com/cpus/intel-core-i5-3230m-vs-intel-core-i3-6100
I'm not saying everything that site says is false, but for beginners, they just look at the gold lines. If you actually read the facts it gives about each chip, you might find the 6100 is better. But it's just pointless to use that site when you have ones like **UserBenchmark** and **HWBench**.

Edit: Anandtech is indeed another great option that I didn't mention and was brought up in comments. And also, remember to use ALL of these sites before making a decision/argument, as it's not _impossible_ for one of the sites  to have a mistake every once in a while.

Edit: Bolding websites I mentioned, as I'm seeing lots of people aren't noticing them.

Edit: I'm also seeing some confusion concerning the link I used. The link I used isn't the website the poor man was confused about, that's CPUboss. The link I used was from a good website to show that the 6100 is the clear winner, but also gives reasons to consider the other CPU, such as low TDP. But unlike CPUboss, HWBench doesn't let that weigh in on which CPU is _better_, it just lists it as the advantages that CPU has over the other. I hope this clears things up!"
buildapc,"This didn't appear to be against the rules, but if it is, my apologies.

To begin, I found this sub around October of 2019. I had been making parts lists and playing around just for fun after reading countless posts and lists and opinions of people here, because my PC at the time was built in 2013 and was definitely struggling on the lowest settings possible, and I was dreaming of a new one.

Come January 2020, I worked a lot during winter vacation and spent about $2500 on a completely new rig with quality parts and peripherals, and even built it to accept a new 30xx series card when they came out and use it to its fullest potential. I immediately fell in love with it and it shrunk my wallet along with my other hobbies.

Fast forward to today, as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, my school completely made all classes virtual to the end of the semester as of today, and my summer classes are all likely going to be virtual too. 

That being said, my old computer wouldn't have been able to handle the virtual programs well that I need to use as an electrical engineering major. But with this new setup and 3 monitors, it's a breeze already, and my new rig just laughs at what ever task I give it with 30 windows open for guides on how to do my programming, calculations and drawings, etc...

Along with the fact itll clearly give me something to do (along with the weight set I just bought for my basement so I can avoid the gym) I'll clearly be spending a lot of time on it, and it's already made my life easier and we have only just started it all.

So thank you, r/buildapc. You guys convinced me to build a new rig at the best time possible, gave me something to occupy my time while I'm stuck in the house, and made my build much smoother than I could ever have hoped for.

EDIT:

[Due to popular demand, heres a pic of the setup](http://imgur.com/gallery/PwlgLrb)

Without using a PC parts list because I'm on my phone and itll be a pain to put one together until I get back to my PC, Ill just map the basics out here for it

CPU: i7 9700kf EDIT3: I got the KF about 60 or 70$ cheaper than the K I believe. There was a sale on the KF that didnt apply to the K, and they were 20$ cheaper than the K anyways. Integrated graphics arent really useful to me

GPU: challenger 5700xt (this was bought on sale for about 350$. Its used as a place holder for an eventual 3080 or what ever eventually comes out, and itll be resold. Either that or I'll be picking up a lightly used 2nd hand 2080 ti during the rush for the 30xx stuff)

RAM: 3600 vengeance 

MOBO: asrock phantom gaming 6

Case: thermaltake supressor f31 (I've since removed the trays and intend on water cooling my gpu when I make the switch, so I got a large case for the extra room

all with a 1 TB adata SSD

2 outside monitors are cheap acer and benq 60 hz monitors I picked up over the years, the center one is an acer xf270h at 144hz

For everything, stands, pc, peripherals, etc... it was somewhere around 2300(including the fridge)? 1600 on the dot after taxes for the PC

EDIT 2: some people asked about the laptop and questioned how tough it would be to do anything I needed to on a ""normal"" computer. None of the programs I use need this rig. My old one was just slow, cluttered and was beginning to have parts die.

My laptop pictured here that I got for 450$ can run anything my school needs us to. The school is also working with trying to make accommodations for students who dont have computers and internet and have been making frequently communications with all about it.

The laptop is used for my circuit labs. We use the digilent analog discovery to power, and take recordings/measurements for our bread board circuits. I use the laptop for the testing for that, and do the lab reports, etc... on the desktop and with 3 monitors, can have matlab, netflix, the assignment/google for help, and word for the lab report open all at the same time incredibly easily"
buildapc,"So I mixed up my power cords for my screen and PC. Does which one is which matter (can I plug either into the PC or screen)? If not, how do I figure out which is which?"
buildapc,"https://m.imgur.com/a/PYNzngZ

I've been gaming on an 2009 HP desktop since, well....2009. For the past few years I've been just playing CSGO since it's the only thing it could handle that I found fun.  I've wanted a better pc however so i could stream and play more games.  Finally, back in September, I got a dishwashing job (I'm 18 as a senior in high school) to save up money for my dream i7 + 1080 build. 

Dishwashing fucking sucks.  It's overworking, ur not really respected by anyone in or out of the job, and I just wanted to quit every shift.  But my motivation to be able to have a sick pc that can stream and to prove my stingy dad wrong that ""I can't build a computer because I don't know enough"". So i just bit my tongue and suffered thru it.  My club advisor recommended me to buy parts over time if they went on sale, so i got a 1080 in october for like $470, and then just kept budgeting my small paychecks and collecting from there. I spent months staying up till like 2-3 AM on school nights to watch tutorials and PC building videos. And lurking on this sub whenever i was chilling outside to find mistakes and problems ppl run into so I could study.  

And finally in March I have everything and now it's spring break and time to build. Sunday i spent half the day cleaning under my nasty ass desk to disassemble the old pc and make my gaming station look as clean as possible.

And today (Monday) was build day.  My mom actually made me do laundry before i started building and i got so paranoid of static i was wiping my hands and arms on anything metal i could find lol. And then noon rolled around and i started building on our small kitchen countertop (my room is fully carpeted, desk is already fully cleaned and has my keyboard, mouse, and monitor waiting for new pc to hook up). I wore slippers (I live in Hawaii, Flip-flops for the rest of u lol) to protect myself from static whenever I had to walk on carpet to see the back side.

And it took 9. Fucking. Hours. Whoever said PC building is really easy is a liar. (Jk it's my first time and I just suck but I just gotta vent a bit).  CPU installation onto the motherboard was the most terrifying experience ever. The retention arm took so much force to pull down it scared the shit out of me.  Installing the fully modular supply wasnt too bad, but for some reason only the bottom two holes could be screwed in, not the top two cuz there wasnt proper alignment with the case to screw them. Ah still held strong and secure tho. I then laid down the case on the PSU cables (installing the psu first was a mistake, i blame Paul lol jk) which seemed sketch, to install the mobo.

It took like 45 MINUTES to install the mobo into the case. The standoffs would NOT line up, it was an extremely tight fit in the case. I had to remove both fans on the h500i to put it in. A screw even got dropped and wedged under this small thingy on the mobo and i had to use a used toothpick to pry it out. Finally tho it all lined up and i got it down and could finally lift the case off the PSU cables. 

Then the nzxt kraken x62 aio. I knew from a long time ago it would be kinda complicated to install, but holy shit was it frustrating. Lining up and screwing the stupid radiator bracket, fans, and radiator for indirect mounting was the hardest shit ever. And even after i finished that 40 min later, i had to take it all apart again cuz the STUPID radiator bracket was too high for the thumbscrew so I had to readjust the whole thing so it would be lower. Took me an hour for just installing the indirect radiator/fans 

Installing the pump was pretty stressful too, but i could do it quicker in like 15 mins. I forgot to mention too that i had like almost zero lighting the whole time apart from the shitty ceiling kitchen light.  I had to constantly use my phone flashlight and heavy duty flashlight to see into my ALSO black case/mobo. 

Plugging in all the cables wasnt too bad, but routing some of them like the CPU power was a pain. And cable managing in the back was kind of a pain too. Lots of cables would get stuck under the cable bar, and it was a total mess. I forgot there was velcros tho in the back lol.

Texted my friend saying ive been working for 7 hours and he said he built his first time in 2 hours lol. He's not being toxic or anything but still lol.

Installing the drives was another pain. The SSD wasnt too hard since it could attach above the PSU shroud, but connecting the SATA data cables was a pain cuz i didnt know which end went where (like the L shaped plug). Hoping it didnt really matter, so i plugged the flat end into the SSD and the L shape into the mobo and routed it so it could plug in and hide.  

Then the HDD. I got the second data cable and OH LOOK THEYRE BOTH FLAT ENDED. But i had already painfully cable managed the SSD cable so i wasnt replugging it.  And i checked the manual how to get the drive cage out.  IT SAYS IT USES THE SAME SCREWS FOR THE DRIVE CAGE AND SECURING THE HDD. But theyre not, the drive cage has bigger flatter ends so u can secure it and u use the same screws as the mobo to secure the hdd. I spent an hour confused as to why the tiny SSD screws i had mistakenly thought could be used to install the HDD as well werent securing the drive cage. Took an hour to install the HDD (I know im retarded).

Then the GPU. It actually wasnt too bad, however it was really big and a tight fit inside my case.  I forgot there was a guard on the GPU however so i spent 5 mins wondering why tf wasnt it going in? Was it actually not compatible? Then i was like ""oh im stupid"" and took the guard off.

And then everything had pretty much been done, just a bit of cable managing to make sure no fans hit cables and the back panel could close (just push the cables in lol no ones gonna see it).

I took a break cuz i hadnt eaten in 9 hours, and braced myself for failure test booting it. I hit the power button and i saw a red light and everything shut off. I wasnt really suprised. And then a red and then orange light and i was like ""wait wtf"" and then a green light, the case lit up and screen display showed and i actually screamed in joy lol.  

Finally feels like all my meaningless work ive put in for the past 6 months has finally paid off, and im so excited to finally have my very own creation to game on! 

AND HOLY SHIT SSD'S ARE INSANE IT LITERALLY TAKES LESS THAN 30 SECONDS TO BOOT UP WINDOWS. I'm so used to turning on the pc and having to wait like half an hour for the pc to configure, warmup, etc.

Sorry for this long ass post/rant lol im just really happy and wanted to just vent and thank this amazing subreddit for really helping me out. Huge thanks to Bitwit, Paul, and Joey Delgado for all the amazing content they put out.

Yes i know my cable management is..... mediocre. But im really happy it came out nonetheless.

Quick questions

Is it ok if the PSU is just held by the two bottom screws. Like i said, the screwholes for the psu and case dont match up at the top, and the only way to screw them is to put the screw thru the chain vent thingy. It feels strong anyway.

Why does the power cable thing u plug into the kraken x62 pump (next to the usb) feel so loose? Like i made it so it felt sorta secure, but a small tug or different angle of the cables and it just slips out.

I enjoyed using CAM for the RGB setting on the pump and case (first time with RGB, I love it, its so aesthetically pleasing to look at and play with) However, I have heard all the complaints about datamining and high network usage and shit. Is it ok to just always close it in the background? I would jusr open it for rgb setting and to check temps. 

Thanks for reading this long lol. 

TL:DR- Spent 6 months slaving away at a shitty dishwashing job, spent 9 full hours straight building my pc and ran into a shit load of problems causing tons of frustration, friend told me he did it in 2 hours his first time, and finally booted up first try and fulfilled my long dream to a high end pc.

Edit: Never expected this to blow up so much! Reading all the kind comments and compliments you guys have makes me so happy and really makes me feel even more proud of myself. Its 5 am now because i was commenting on everyones stuff but thankfully its spring break now XD. This is really becoming my favorite sub and all of you guys are awesome! Thank you so much *bow bow* 

Edit 2: My first Gold! Thank you guys so much :) So before going to sleep i still cant decide if i should invert the radiator. I REALLY dont want to go thru screwing it all back together, especially now there's the gpu and the pump attached. Can u guys let me know if its REALLY necassary for the tubes to be on top or on bottom is ok?"

buildapc,"Preface to the story:

My brother and I are very close. We didn’t have a lot growing up. Growing up with only one parent who had their own issues meant I kinda looked after him. 

Birthdays were never a big deal in our families. A cake, $20, and that was about it. So this year I decided I was going to get my brother the computer he’d always wanted. 

Video games were always a way to escape for us and how we’d bonded. Now that we’re older and can afford things I’ve switched over to pc gaming. My brother would come visit and play on mine. I always told him he should get one, but he always said he couldn’t afford it (even though if he saved for a bit he could).

I posted a GoFundMe on fb (hiding it from him) asking if anyone would want to donate to his birthday. Not surprisingly (as my brother is well loved) we got lots of donations for his build. I didn’t hit the full goal, but it was enough to get him a good system.

After being a long term lurker on this page and watching just about every YouTube video known to man on building instead of buying pre-made, I decided to build it myself using the donations to buy the parts. 

The build:
Ryzen R5 2600 CPU
MSI B450 Gaming Plus motherboard
16 GB Corsair DDR4 2400 RAM
NVIDIA GTX 1070 GPU
EVGA 550 B3 power supply
Corsair Carbide 275 case
Acer - S271HL 27"" monitor

We also got him an Xbox One controller and a Corsair HS60 headset. Oh, and a generic keyboard and my old Razer Naga.

Needless to say he was a little shocked. I wrapped little gag gifts and dvds in the empty boxes the components came in. He made a comment about how I must have been upgrading my system recently. Then he got to his card and opened it. I listed everyone who had donated and how much we all loved him. I then told him to go look behind the couch to see what he got. I set it up for him and after he created his steam account I shared my library with him. I also bought him a month of Origin Premier. 

Thank you, r/buildapc. With all of the knowledge on here I was able to give my brother a gift he’ll remember forever. Thank you for giving me confidence to do my first build. Also, thank you for reading this long-winded story.

[pics of the build! ](https://imgur.com/a/ijC5OD1)

EDIT - Thank you so much for all of the kind words!! I really wish now I’d known about the Ryzen needing faster RAM but now I know for the future.

PS - Also I had a few people message me and ask if they could donate or give Steam gift cards. I told my brother this and he said we should give to Extra Life instead. Extra Life (in case you didn’t know) is a charity organization for gamers whose funds go to the Children’s Miracle Network. Over the last ten years I’ve raised over $26,000 for the Children’s Hospital of Richmond through them. My brother was born with a cleft palate and the Children’s Hospital there took care of him until he was 18. Once a month we’d drive there (about 3 hours away) for his therapy and assorted surgeries.

buildapc,"Hello everybody!

I play a lot of video games, and like to keep up to date with computers and tech, and both IRL and amongst my friends online I have something of a reputation for being ""that tech guy"".

As a result of this, I often find myself recommending computer builds or parts to people, or having to explain what certain computer-related terms mean, or how they might be useful and/or relevant.

I have been doing this enough lately that I sort of realized that lots of people might benefit from a good, well-written guide on computer parts and terminology.

Yes, it is true that there are places where people can ask questions about computers already, however I think that having a good, singular reference point that can be easily pointed to for those that want to learn on their own, or who have trouble asking for help from others will be very useful, as well as allowing much more depth in the answers than could otherwise be reasonably given.

So I wrote just such a guide.

Several, actually - As there are numerous different audiences for a ""PC Guide"", I have written several documents that I hope will be broad enough in accessibility and scope to provide useful information for everybody, regardless of their prior computing knowledge:

* Technical Details: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p482g3YPWjZZ-SEq\_SLe\_BakGn6SEzxW/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p482g3YPWjZZ-SEq_SLe_BakGn6SEzxW/view?usp=sharing)  
Current Version: 1.7  
A very long and in-depth guide that covers \[almost all\] of the terms that are used for computer components that a PC user would come across or want to know about.
* Component Specifications: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KDWARbOXCx6VRiratPyT4hO6LommWAiu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KDWARbOXCx6VRiratPyT4hO6LommWAiu/view?usp=sharing)  
A much, *much* shorter and more basic version of the above that covers the most crucial and important terms only.
* Component Compatibility Quick Reference: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PeTua1h5swOZzlJs2qrlePqwx89RNLaV/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PeTua1h5swOZzlJs2qrlePqwx89RNLaV/view?usp=sharing)  
A quick bullet-point list of some important compatibility points that users could check before buying either a PC or components for a PC.
* Industry Overview: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ey48nv4CKgK3cheR-2XUwpz3CP9xR6rE/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ey48nv4CKgK3cheR-2XUwpz3CP9xR6rE/view?usp=sharing)  
A quick overview of some of the most major things in the PC space that affected consumers in 2018 and early 2019.

I hope they help somebody.

If anybody has any comments or errors to point out, then you can leave a comment, message me here on reddit, where I am of course u/Ad3506, or at [Ad3506@gmail.com](mailto:Ad3506@gmail.com).

Please make sure that any error you wish to point out is actually in the most recent version of the document, though.

Thank you to everybody who has suggested suggestions or pointed out typos or grammatical errors!

Edits: I have now started adding version numbers on the first \[title\] page of the technical details.  
Newer versions will be clearer, better explained, have less types, and have more info in them, so I highly recommend using the most recent version."

buildapc,"Or does it?

Since a week ago my dad is high on the idea of mining. He is planning to spend money (we cant really spend) 
 on a rig and I am losing arguements. 

I need precise, short, easy to understand facts to convince him that getting Into mining is a bad idea. Or am I wrong? 

His idea is to set up and forget about it, let it sit and generate income ($500 a month he says). 

I am aware this is a little off topic, but I am afraid of I go over to mining subs they won't really argue for my side.

Edit: afaik he had planned to get himself 6 mid range GPUs. Not sure which exactly, 1060 (?). I am aware of the fact that peak of mining is gone. But he is a stubborn person and I won't convince him with an idea that barrier to entry is hard. That won't cut.

Edit: well, that went well. I actually have collected myself and no longer seeing all this as a waste of time and money. I will have a conversation with him Tomorrow, exploring our options and future.

Thank you all for explaining it in from both perspectives. I appreciate it.

EDIT: I am sorry. I thought my last edit would close the discussion. My bad. We spoke and he decided to calm down hand think more thoroughly this through. He's gonna look at the numbers and make his own decision.

Again, thank you all for input. "

After using/gaming on my 144hz Viewsonic Xg2401 for a few months, It's painful to use a 60hz Asus or Dell monitor. 144hz is so much smoother, not only in games when pushing 144 fps, but also just for general use. Watching videos, web browsing. It feels and looks so much smoother. Don't make the jump unless you're prepared to never go back. That's my opinion."

**WOAH.** [danketiquette](https://www.reddit.com/user/danketiquette) gave me *Reddit Gold* over this. And to think I had heartbeats over the 20 replies and 150 points on my thread alone. You are my hero man, I haven't felt this happy over being handed a banana since ever. Somewhere between a state of shock and bliss now. I don't even know what Reddit gold does but thank you so much man.

Some points of interest:

Don't bother fanboying over your favourite distro too hard. It won't take long before the next Linux device enters your household and decides to mess with your head by supporting every distro under the sun *except* your favourite one. Think about it this way: Having access to multiple distributions, all catered to different situations, is *way* more of a feature than any Windows system could ever hope to achieve.

No seriously Arch fanboys it's time to calm down, I love Arch as much as the next basement dweller but if you stare blindly into the light all it will do is burn out your eyes. What would you do if Arch suddenly disappeared? Install Void Linux and cry on their forums how everything isn't Arch? Like Windows users do on Linux forums? Because they are stuck in their ways? Notice a pattern? Man I talk in too many condescending questions.

The only reason I mentioned Emacs over Vim is because Emacs has superior support in graphical environments, sorry Vim fanboys. Again in 2018 it really won't matter that much because both have large enough bases of support. Whichever gets the job done in the *best way possible for you* is the one you should go for. You should be enhancing your workflow in whatever way is productive to you.

**Okay back to mindless bullet listing:**

* Ever seen the [Android root folder?](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LsRUE.png) Obviously you'll need to be rooted to access it, but once you are [you can use any file explorer with root access](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx&hl=en) to browse through it. Not really practical, but it might be neat.
* You'll probably learn about this early on but I'm still surprised that [Samba](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/samba) is now the bees knees when it comes to file sharing, despite originally coming from windows. [There's NFS too](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NFS) but people will shout at you for using an non-encrypted protocol. I'm still hoping to find something better to be honest, but you can't argue with something that is actually Windows compatible.

Working on an update but I'm too busy being a retard on the internet right now. Coming soon I suppose. Valve time though."
linux4noobs,"With alarming frequency I see posts on this subreddit involving relatively basic troubleshooting questions from users running Kali Linux. I wrote this as a response to that. I think Kali Linux is great. I just don't think everybody should be using it as a desktop OS.

**The TL;DR for this post could be taken straight from the [Kali FAQ](http://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux)**: ""If you are unfamiliar with Linux generally, if you do not have at least a basic level of competence in administering a system, if you are looking for a Linux distribution to use as a learning tool to get to know your way around Linux, or if you want a distro that you can use as a general purpose desktop installation, Kali Linux is probably not what you are looking for.""

*Dear Linux noobs,*

Linux is cool. You're interested in Linux and that makes you cool too. You should be proud of your interest in Linux. You're now part of a community that is full of cool people (OK, a few of us are jerks, but what can you do).

What else is cool? Computer hacking. Password cracking. Network penetration. These things are neat, and the people who can do them are usually pretty cool too (though some of them are jerks too). Learning to do these things is fun, and if you want to do it, you should. When practiced responsibly, these things can make fun hobbies, or even a lucrative career. The purpose of this post is not to discourage anybody from learning to do these things.

One of the major problems new Linux users face when starting out is figuring out which Linux distribution is right for them. There are a lot of options after all. Everybody likes to recommend their favorite distro (and also occasionally give their opinion on their least favorite distro). Very frequently I see questions in this subreddit, and in related subreddits, like ""What distro should I use?"", ""I want to learn to code, what distro would be good for me?"", ""What is the best distro for python programming?"", or ""What distro should I use to learn penetration testing?"". New Linux users who might be interested in penetration testing (or some other related topic) might, by some means or another, discover Kali Linux. They might think ""Hey, I want to learn Linux and also pen-testing! I should use Kali Linux."" They'd probably be wrong.

The thing is, most desktop distributions provide access to the same software. If you want to watch Youtube videos and write email, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, etc, are all equally capable of that. If you want to learn python programming, you can do that on any of those distributions. Similarly, if you want to learn pen-testing, you can do it from any of those distributions.

Kali Linux is a distribution specifically designed to be a toolkit for professional pen-testers. As such, it might be very attractive to new Linux users who are interested in security. However, Kali is /not/ designed as a general purpose Linux distro. Some elements of it's design are simply not suited for use as a general purpose desktop. If you're a new Linux user who installs Kali Linux chances are you will have a frustrating experience. The Kali Linux maintainers even have a FAQ page ""Is Kali Linux right for me?"" 

http://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux

Please read that article before deciding to use Kali as a desktop OS, especially if you're new to Linux. If you don't yet understand some of the points made in that article that's probably a sign to avoid Kali for now.

It's quite often that I see people asking questions like ""How do I do X in Kali Linux?"" or ""[Kali] Y is not working. Please help."" Unfortunately these users don't usually get the help they need, which makes me sad. The posts are often dismissed or downvoted. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'd wager that most of the people asking these questions don't need Kali. They need a desktop distribution.

I am worried that if your first adventures with Linux are in Kali you will have a frustrating experience and be turned off from the whole endeavor. Your questions might be dismissed and left unanswered because you appear to be in over your head.

*Using Kali Linux as your first desktop Linux distro is like learning to drive on a racecar. Please don't do it.*

Peace."
linux4noobs,"I am disturbed by the number of people in this sub who feel shame for using Ubuntu. Listen up. Ignore whatever you read about Ubuntu not being for pros. IT IS!!

A pro is someone who uses Linux for their profession. I write software for Linux as my job and manage a fleet of thousands of Linux servers, hosting services you've more than likely used. Several of my team members use Ubuntu and we're about as pro as it gets when it comes to Linux. Why? Because it just works. The only reason I don't use Ubuntu is because I prefer Red Hat based systems, so my servers are CentOS and my desktop is Fedora. If they didn't exist, I'd be MORE than happy with Ubuntu.

Linux pros do not want to spend time tinkering with their desktop to make it look pretty. You do that shit when you're just starting out on your Linux journey. Pros use Linux for the power it grants you as a user. Ubuntu gives you the same power as any other distro. Maybe even more so because of how fucking easy it is to use.

Most of the Ubuntu naysayers are amatures who've installed Arch and now think they're experts. Pfffft. Please. Installing Arch is NOTHING SPECIAL! If they'd installed Gentoo or Linux from Scratch, I'd be a bit more impressed.

Do not listen to them. Pick a distro you like and stick with it. Ubuntu is fucking great. Enjoy it!"
linux4noobs,"I know we all have our choice of distribution, but when people are asking which distro to use for their first install can we stop recommending Arch or Gentoo, and start recommending actual user friendly distros like Ubuntu and derivatives, Manjaro, Fedora or openSUSE? Forcing a noob to just jump into compiling software from scratch or building their OS from the ground up doesn’t sound like the right thing to do. If we push them into more difficult distributions they might lose confidence if they break something on install and turn their back on Linux for good. If the goal is to get more people to use and stick with Linux why don’t we start recommending user friendly first and then if they request a new distro as a more experienced user then recommend Arch etc.?

Just asking the community on their thoughts on this idea because I see it a lot on posts by new users asking which distro they should install."
linux4noobs,"If you're new to Linux and want to get a solid knowledge of the terminal there is really no better book, that I know of, to get you started than this: [http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php).

It's what got me into the Linux world and I haven't looked back ever since. Have read it cover to cover and it's now in its 5th Internet edition. It's often recommended but it would be nice to have a post dedicated to it so here is that post. I'll give a bit of an overview of what the book covers - hopefully, in a way understandable to someone who has no Linux experience.

You'll start off with just basic commands: how to move around directories (folders), how to create and remove files, how to edit text files, etc.. Every concept is represented with concrete examples and terminal output is shown pretty much all the time. Many of the sections have commentary on the history of those programs/tools and it's very entertaining and helps to keep things interesting.

As your knowledge progresses you'll be introduced to more programs/tools and learn how  to build your own tools by leveraging a core idea that is central to Linux: using programs/tools that were made to solve very specific problems and leveraging Linux's extremely powerful I/O redirection abilities to make those programs communicate with each other to perform increasingly complex tasks.

Eventually, you'll be taught how to write 'scripts' (basically small programs) that will allow you to forego interactive use of the programs/tools you've learned to use earlier and will enable you to automate just about everything you can think of.

There are a lot of links provided to further reading on just about every topic.

In summary: the book lays a great foundation for the absolute beginner and serves as a springboard to learn more advanced topics."
linux4noobs,"Hi everyone!

Yesterday I've stumbled across The Bandits game, from OverTheWire. It blew me away for how fun it was and how much it made me learn about linux with a very biref introduction to more complex concepts. I know it is probably well\-known by most of you but I belive it is a very good place for beginners to start.

You can play it [here](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/), hope you enjoy!"
linux4noobs,"[My thread a few days ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/ei06t7/i_really_want_to_love_linux_but_im_getting_sick/) really blew up, so I thought that I would post an update in case anybody was curious.

I expected this subreddit to tear me apart for being negative about their beloved Linux but the vast majority of what I got instead was understanding and support.

So as  much as I wanted to be an Arch badass like everybody else, I decided to make my life easier and just try striaght up Ubuntu 19.10

And it has been AWESOME!!

Now granted, a lot of that is because of everything that I've already learned so far. But for the most part, it Just Works ™

Conky works better than any other distro I've tried (they would all minimise it if I push Super + D, but on Ubuntu it works properly), TeamViewer which for some reason was compeltely broken on other distros just works perfectly without doing anything special. My brightness buttons work just fine (because why wouldn't they!?!?), hell, even my fingerprint sensor works!

Now some things were a bit different and I still had to Google a bunch of stuff. But instead of digging deep and going through tons of trial and error, the answers are easy to find and work on the first try.

Now customization-wise it is definitely much more limited than other KDE-based things, but I would definitely rather struggle with tinkering than struggle with functioning.

Thank you so much to everyone that replied to the other thread with their experiences, sympathies, and advice.

Mission accomplished, I DO love Linux!"
linux4noobs,"I've used Linux for about a year now and learned a handful of stuff along the way, but man I wish I had started with Linuxjourney.com there is so much useful info there and I'm not even through the novice section yet. I HIGHLY recommend any new Linux user to go through this site. It will make you one with the terminal. 

EDIT: here is the link: https://linuxjourney.com/ "
linux4noobs,"First off, I love a lot of things about Linux. The speed, the customization, workspaces are awesome, and I actually love using the terminal. It's so fast and I actually find it fun to navigate using the keyboard, rsync is amazing, and I love writing scripts like my own little mini-programs.

But it just seems like every single thing I try to do required an hour of Googling and trial & error.

Right off the bat, WiFi didn't work. I scoured the internet and eventually found that if I installed a specific driver and a specific kernel and a specific header then it would all work. Luckily I could USB tether from my phone to get that all done and it worked!

I better make a backup of my system and those drivers and stuff! Pop in a flash drive and nothing happens. Off to Google to learn how to mount it in the terminal. 

Then I wanted it to mount my NAS automatically on boot, but I had a lot of problems with it trying and failing to do that before being connected to the network. Again, a TON of searching and trying all kinds of variations in the fstab before I found the right combination of arguments to make it work.

Then the computer would just randomly freeze sometimes. Completely unrecoverable. I couldn't really track this one down so I decided to try a different distro.

Redo all of the stuff I did before on the new distro (which was pretty easy because I had backups) Then after doing all this work I restarted and just got a blaack screen after logging in. Back to Google and I eventually find that with this distro I need to add ""nomodeset"" to grub. Whew, we're back in.

Then I constantly get some popup wanting to connect to an external display that doesn't exist? Back to Google, find some service to shut off to make that go away.

Then I like having Remote Desktop software so that I can control my computer from other computers or my phone. So I install TeamViewer but most of the buttons in the app don't do anything when I click on them, I can't log in. Tried Googling that for a while but couldn't figure it out. So I tried Chrome Remote Desktop instead, get it installed fine but then I get an error message/crash when I connect. More searching and I find some obscure file that I need to create to get that working.

And now the last straw is that the brightness controls don't work. I push the function keys on the laptop and the slider pops up on the display and moves but the brightness doesn't change. I've probably spent about 4 hours trying to find a solution to this one but nothing works.

I've been through four distros now because I keep running into different unfixable issues and now this might be the end of this one too.

Again, I absolutely love the things that work, when they work, but this is just exhausting, I spend all of my time fixing my computer instead of using it.

**TL;DR: Even single little thing I do requires and hour of Googling and trial & error to make work. Does it ever end!?**

EDIT: This subreddit is pretty great. I was honestly expecting to be absolutely crucified for this post; I was scared to check my inbox this morning. But the vast majority of the comments have been supportive/helpful!

I might just keep plugging away at it, maybe I'll take a break and see if I hate going back to Windows.

Ahhh who am I kidding? 99% chance I'll just try another distro :p"
linux4noobs,"I've seen more than a few replies on this sub that are sarcastic, derisive, dismissive, and just unfriendly.

We get it, you're not getting paid to be tech support here. At the same time, it is a voluntary process, no one is forcing you to solve problems here, so let's just treat OPs with a bit of respect. Boil it down to ""ELI5"" style replies, assume the OP knows nothing, and then you won't get frustrated when confronted with that fact. It's ok for people to be dumb here, that's what the sub is for. So why cop an attitude when that happens? "
linux4noobs,"[http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html)

I'm taking an intro class and our instructor had us play this old-school-style text adventure to help learn Linux commands and file navigation."
linux4noobs,"As the title says, does anyone want a Linux Noob friendly tutorial on how to setup a private VPN in Amazon Web Services on their free tier?

It would cover, AWS and EC2 instances, AWS port configuration, preparing and configuring a headless Ubuntu server, SSH, OpenVPN, DynamicDNS, vim text editor, customising bash, setting up OpenVPN clients, and some other stuff.

I'm a sysadmin and desktop support engineer by trade and I enjoy writing tutorials for people. I hate jargon and like to explain things in a straight forward way.

If people like it, I already have an idea for a second tutoiral on lxc and lxd so you can make the most of your one free EC2 server.

Edit: As /u/mdaffin pointed out. The AWS EC2 instance is offered free for 12 months. After that there is a cost of $0.0116 an hour which works out to be $8.63 a month; still cheaper than most VPN services out there and this way you have full control.

Edit 2: I am half way through writing this. I have decided to do a mini tutorial after this on installing a web interface for OpenVPN. It requires a few prereq's so it's too much to put in one tutorial, besides getting used to the terminal is always better and OpenVPN is super easy to admin. Unfortunately, I now have the pleasure of having to go and move a clients office for the next 7 hours. Hopefully I can finish it tonight, if not tomorrow! I will still keep an eye on this thread and answer questions, comments and discuss.


Edit 3: So it seems like there is a lot of interest in this and I am so excited to do it for you all! Currently I am finishing up an Office move and cursing the printer gods (seriously, who decided that printers were ever a good idea). Should be done in a few hours so will be finalising it then!

Edit4: OK 3/5 through writing it. Just need to write up about OpenVPN and NoIP (which suprisingly is the least of it...). Also need to proof read to make sure it all makes sense. I have a habbit of words of sentenses :p

**EDIT 5:** Guide is up. I'm going away for the long weekend, so it is a little rough, but good enough!!

linux4noobs,"You'll often see people proselytizing for modern linux on the internet saying ""you don't have to use the terminal to do anything anymore! :)""

For noob friendly distributions like Linux Mint, Ubuntu, etc. *they are right*. You  never have to use the terminal to do anything on your system these days. You can install packages through your software manager. You can back things up through GUI interfaces like timeshift. You can copy files, move files, edit files in GUIs like Nautilus, Nemo, Dolphin, etc. You can change system settings in GUIs. **You don't have to use the terminal to do any of this.**

##So why do you need to know the basics if you don't have to use it?

As a user of a computer you will hit some problem. You will find something you don't know how to do, some error message you don't understand, some aspect you want to change and can't find the setting for. When that happens you will go to a search engine and start looking up help. That might take you here or to the arch wiki or to some obscure forum or to some clickbait site. 

And here's the thing; it's difficult to write a guide to fully explain how to fix a problem through the GUI, especially when there's so much variety and customization available on Linux. 

Take installing software: one could say,

> ""Ok go to the *Synaptic Software Center* or maybe go to *Ubuntu Software* or maybe click the thing that just says *Software* or maybe go to the *Pop Shop*... ok now find the search bar... it might be a little magnifying glass or maybe just a big white bar... unless you've changed the theme in which case maybe the icon or color is different, ok now search for the program... next click on the right version, no not that one, that's just plugins and not the actual program, ok now click the Install button.. or maybe it's just a little down arrow."" 

or one can say, 

>""open a terminal and type `sudo apt install <program> ` ""

For this reason almost all *advice*; error fixing, program installing, etc. is terminal based. It skips all the searching through menus to find the right option. It jumps past all the potential differences on each desktop. It's fast, easy and will work if followed exactly. 

Now, the terminal is a very fast, powerful and direct way of interacting with your computer. You give a command it will run it. As `sudo` will warn you the first time it is started 'with great power power comes great responsibility.' If you don't know even the basics, suddenly you will find yourself running commands you have no understanding of blindly and hoping they work. **That means trusting whoever it is that is telling you what commands to run on your computer.** 

For example, you might look up how to install a program and find a whole set of commands you need to run on some shitty clickbait site. If you don't know what ""curl"" is, suddenly you might be downloading random zips from the internet and shoving them into core spots on your system. You might end up compiling something you cloned into your home directory via git clone. You might end up with a huge mess or something actively malicious if you downloaded code from from an unofficial source. When it turns out all you really needed to do was click install in your software manager. 

So while you don't need to use the terminal.... you need to know how to use it.

#tl:dr; You can do almost everything without the terminal but every guide to linux, forum help post, etc. will tell you commands to run and it's bad news bears to run things with no understanding of what strangers are telling you to do to your computer."
linux4noobs,"Hi guys!

I recently found [this](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html) game and it totally blew me away for how fun it was to me, learning some basic commands while solving puzzles, really fun.

# ""Wait, what happens to Windows 7?""

After support ends (1/14/2020), Windows 7 is no longer going to receive security updates. Your computer will continue to work but since Windows 7 will be: 1) not uncommon, 2) lack security updates, 3) used mostly by  people who are not tech/security savvy and who ignored the warnings... it will become the juiciest target for malware out there right now. It'll be open season on grandparents and small businesses who are left on it.

So you have 2 options:

1) upgrade to a newer version of Windows

2) switch to Linux

This post is not going to be a Linux sales pitch. If you *want* Windows 10 and can run Windows 10 then install Windows 10.

# ""Well what is Linux?""

Linux is a free operating system with an emphasis on open source software. It is free to download, try out and install. It is however, not Windows. Some things will work differently and there will be some of a learning curve for a new user.

## Some things that work differently:

* because it is free and open source, anyone can make their own version and distribute it to the community. We call each version put out by a particular group a ""**distro**"" for ""distribution."" That's why you might see some ridiculously complicated graphs and suggestions for all the different versions of Linux (unlike with Windows where there are a few official versions all made by Microsoft)

* because a lot of the software is free and open source, each distro can provide its users with a **repository** of a bunch of pre-packaged software designed to work on your system which you can install, run and update free of charge, this can then all be managed by a **package manager**. On the user side, this works like a phone app store where everything is free.

* because it is free and open source, it can be seen as a threat to Microsoft making money so some software (*Microsoft Office*) will likely never be provided for Linux directly.

* because it is less common than Windows, some companies simply don't make versions of their software for Linux. Adobe is a big one.

# ""Ok, how do I try it out?""

## try out some Linux software on Windows before switching

Checkout https://alternativeto.net/ , and search for any software you tend to use. You can then try out a lot of the stuff available for Linux on Windows too. (edit: this includes MS Office alternatives).

For an organized list of linux software there’s this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/list_of_applications

## Use a virtual machine

Using software like virtual box https://www.virtualbox.org/ you can run Linux inside a program on Windows. This is a really great way to try it because you can do whatever you want in the virtual machine (VM) without changing things on your actual machine. The downside is that your computer has to run both Linux and Windows at the same time while doing this so it might not work well on low spec hardware and it won't let you test that all everything works on your hardware. 

## Boot into the live environment

Linux can actually run off of a USB stick. Doing this let's you test it out on your actual hardware and make sure that everything works correctly without changing anything on your harddrive. The downside is that you generally can't save changes while running off a USB stick so this is intended for testing, installing and recovering but not for extended use or experimentation.

# ""I'm interested in trying it out, what should I start with?""

## Do you want something that looks different from windows?

Ubuntu is the classic newbie friendly Linux distro. By default it has a desktop environment that looks a little more like Mac than Windows but is distinctly different from both. Most Linux instructions online will include help on Ubuntu and there's lots of good forums to help. Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months but maintains a long term support (LTS) release that is supported for 5 years. The 6 month version will have newer software, the LTS version will have (increasingly) older software but still get security updates for that supported time.

Ubuntu's install guide is here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall

## Do you want a windows like desktop environment?

Linux Mint is an even more newbie friendly Linux distro that is based on Ubuntu's LTS release. It's essentially just LTS Ubuntu with some extra help like backup integration and a more windows-like UI. That means basically all of the Ubuntu guides and help carry over but you'll feel more at home coming from Windows 7.

Linux Mint's install guide is here: https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (and it's very well put together for a newbie)

# ""Looks good! Now what?""

Know that while you can do almost everything on Ubuntu and Mint through a graphical interface, a lot of advice and help will give you things to run on the commandline (even if you could do it other ways). Don't be scared of the commandline but also try to look up what you are running to understand it yourself; it's a way of telling your computer exactly what you want it to do... efficient and powerful if you know the basics but it's not a good idea to trust every random person who gives you a command to run from the internet.

Linux malware/viruses are extremely rare and you won't get anything bad if you download from the official repositories. Part of the reason is that most of the time, you are not giving programs permission to install, update or change things on your system. To give them permission, you need to enter the ""root password"" so that anything where you aren't entering your password or typing ""sudo"" can only affect your documents and personal stuff but anything where you entering your password can make bigger changes to your system. Take note of anytime someone is telling you to add a new repository or download and run something from somewhere else. 

If for some reason Ubuntu and Mint are not working for you, you can start branching out and trying other distros. Everyone's got their own favorite but these are just the best places to start. To learn in a more in-depth structured way check out: https://linuxjourney.com/

**Have fun with it!**"
linux4noobs,"Hi, I'm having a problem with Ubuntu, beacuse my laptop has the Intel gpu, plus an Nvidia one. Someone has suggested me to use a thing called Bumblebee. Would the issue still exist with other distros? "
linux4noobs,"I did it! 


After year's of posting redundant questions I got my first job as a certified system administrator and today was the day I felt right for my role. I helped craft a testing environment which was previously undocumented and untested to something that can be recreated and proven to work.

Me and my team made a binary level replication of a live database which can be killed and taken over by a slave copy on a weekly basis to implement a regular patching cycle, this in turn will bring out of date machines to a level where downtime is not an issue.

I did it, I am a systems administrator and I love my job! "
linux4noobs,"*Edit: Thank you, Anonymous user, for the Platinum! <3*

I've been using Ubuntu 19.04/19.10 for six months and wanted to share what has helped me out the most so far in my journey. I'll keep this as succinct as I can. Here you go!

## Take notes on any changes you make to your system

This includes every package you install. I have a `refs` directory in my Dropbox folder with some markdown files for different ideas I'm learning. I chose markdown to practice that format but text files work fine. I have files for:

* **tmux:** commands and hotkeys I'm working on committing to memory
* **vim:** commands, hotkeys, and notes on plugins (I mostly use neovim but still take notes in this file)
* **ricing:** has a full, simplified markdown table of all my i3 keybindings (helps me see what hotkeys I'm NOT using yet!)
* **webdev:** reminders of which webdev concepts were covered in the courses I've taken, plus an ongoing list of ideas for projects
* **journey:** the ongoing plan I'm following for learning web development from HTML5 all the way up to React/Redux
* **general linux:** has an **Installation Timeline** (any apt/snap/pip/pip3 install is noted here), **Things To Research** (if I see something online but don't have time to look into it, I put it in this section), **Script Ideas**, **Diagnostics** (sysadmin stuff I'm committing to memory), and a generic **Notes** section for when I do something tedious and don't want to forget it (like how I set up each of my drive's partitions/filesystems)
* **markdown:** A full, super simple list of all markdown formatting so I can get better at creating repos while helping myself stay more organized

There is no need to do all of this, but I like this separation of ideas so it can scale with me for years. Whenever I start learning about something specific and vast enough to warrant extensive notes, I will make a new file.

I have an alias for each file so they are always a few keystrokes away from being in front of me. You could also just alias the directory. I use `refX` where X is the letter for that file. `refv` for vim, `reft` for tmux, `refl` for general linux, and so on.

**Edit:** An awesome suggestion from u/wrek: **""Make ONE change at a time.""** Super valid point. Make a habit of installing, then testing, making changes, then testing, and so on. If you do five things with no testing and find out something broke, you now have five directions to go. Even if what broke leads you to reaching out for help, you'll know exactly *how* to ask for help if you know what change caused the breaking.

## Get to know your filesystem

I'd suggest doing this before you get that far into installing anything, but it's never too late to know your filesystem.

[This video from Engineer Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFIoRLqhFpo) and [this video from DorianDotSlash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw) helped me a lot!

After watching these, I stopped trying to manually install anything beyond the home directory. Some applications like [simple terminal](https://st.suckless.org/) or packages you download will automatically put themselves somewhere outside the home directory and I let those applications do what they were designed to do, but if I manually install stuff it is usually in `~/.local` or something like that.

This is what I meant by ""stick with best practices"". It seems ideal to stay out of most deeper directories until you know what you're doing. I'm still a noob so I'll stay at home where it's safe :)

## Snapshots, Snapshots, Snapshots

If you haven't already, use something like [Timeshift](https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift) or [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) to start taking snapshots as soon as possible.

This suggestion saved my ass when I tried, stumbled, and failed at setting up as many applications as possible to change colors via pywal. I didn't keep track of how I set it all up and when I decided to try dismantling it, I couldn't remember how to get everything back to ""pre-pywal"" setup.

Luckily I had a Timeshift snapshot from about 10 minutes after my fresh OS install. **Installing Timeshift and getting snapshots started, including taking an initial manual snapshot that would never get auto-deleted, is the first thing I did after installing Ubuntu.**

That was easily the smartest decision I made last year and it took about 12 minutes to undo a month's worth of disorganized configuring.

After that, I started taking notes on everything I installed and set everything up more carefully. Although I've messed up small stuff since then, I have also been able to refer to notes and undo them no problem. My system (and brain) feel a lot more stable.

My Timeshift setup is pretty simple. I have daily snapshots and boot snapshots (max of 7 snapshots for each type), plus a few manual snapshots that get me back to ""10 minutes post-install"" if needed.

## For non-system files, try to be cloud based

Aside from my Downloads folder, every file in my home directory is in Dropbox. Most folders in `$HOME` are symlinks to their equivalent in Dropbox, and I have automatic backups for anything else (like stuff from `~/.config`, `~/.fonts`, etc). Those are also backed up into Dropbox.

**Edit:** This could also be done with a server you run/own, or another cloud storage service of some sort. The goal with this suggestion is to **have your files stored in a way that protects you from a drive failure**. Don't store everything only on your main working drive because you'll be screwed if it gives out. An external, ideally automated solution for file storage lets you pick back up where you left off immediately after replacing a drive without losing any data.

## If you have time and interest, try doing something the hard way

rsync is a great choice for backing up files in your home directory. I could have just used its extensive options, but decided it'd be fun to write a script that handles those backups instead. By doing that I wound up learning a lot about writing scripts.

For some reason I've had a hard time getting Dropbox to show up on Polybar. That tray icon is how I usually manage my sync settings. I can still log out of i3 and into GNOME to pull those settings up, but I realized I could also [make a Rofi-powered menu](https://github.com/NicksIdeaEngine/dropboxsyncmenu) to manage those settings. It was another fun learning experience in scripting, and more practice on setting up repositories.

## Share your work!

Did you write a script? Post it in r/bash and ask for input. You'll probably hear some great suggestions on simplifying or improving it!

If you love customizing, post your setup in r/unixporn for others to see.

Share your creations. You'll get valuable feedback, help a fellow noob, or both!

## Conclusion

Take notes, get to know your filesystem, start using snapshots if you haven't already, leverage the cloud, keep an eye out for fun challenges that'll force you to learn something, and if you make something useful go ahead and share it with the community.

Knowing the easy AND hard way might seem redundant, but the point is practice. Someday you'll encounter something that doesn't have an easy solution, and you'll be better prepared if you've tackled challenging problems already."

**The low-down:** Microsoft terminated support for Windows XP on April 8, 2014.

**What to do:** Your decision, but here we recommend you upgrade your computer to Linux.

**How do I:** An overview of the migration process is as follows:

1. run a backup
2. select a distribution
3. download the ISO
4. verify the hash of the ISO (aside from security, this also will detect a corrupted download)
5. burn the ISO to CD and/or load it onto a USB stick/drive (to do this, try [YUMI](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/) or [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/) - more [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_to_create_Live_USB_systems))
6. do a test boot with a LiveCD if possible (optional, recommended)
7. install the new OS
8. configure/install any missing drivers/troubleshooting etc
9. select/install software
10. migrate users' data from the old OS to the new OS

**Selecting a distribution:** 

Have a look at the various Linux distributions available (there's quite a few to choose from) and make a shortlist of possibles. Many of them have a ""Live CD"" which is a version of the system on CD, which can be downloaded and burned, then you boot off the CD and you can see whether the software works for you, without making any changes to your existing Windows install. You can find a list of distributions in many places, including these:

- [The /g/ OS guide](http://i.imgur.com/wXsA1Ls.jpg) (updated to v.1.3.2)
- [Comparison of Linux distributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions)
- [DistroWatch](http://www.distrowatch.com/)

We can't recommend a particular distribution here, but try the comments, or the articles linked below, or just browse the sidebar. Several distributions have been specifically designed to provide a Windows-like experience, a list of these is below. You could also try the [Linux Distribution Chooser](http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/) (2011).

**Windows-like distributions:**

- [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) - [install guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/InstallingLubuntu)
- [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/)
- [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org/)
- [Linux Lite](https://www.linuxliteos.com/) - [install guide](https://www.linuxliteos.com/manual/install.html)
- [Linux Mint - Mate edition](http://www.linuxmint.com/) (the heaviest one in this list)

**Lightweight distributions:** (suited to older or low-powered hardware)

- [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) - [install guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/InstallingLubuntu)
- [CrunchBang Linux](http://crunchbang.org/)
- [Bodhi Linux](http://www.bodhilinux.com/)
- [DistroWatch search - ""Old Computers"" category](http://distrowatch.com/search.php?category=Old+Computers)
- [list of Lightweight Linux distributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Linux_distribution)

**Important details:**

- **Run a backup:** That way, even if you toast your machine, you will be able to recover your data. If your backup software has a ""verify"" feature, use it. You'll want to backup to an external device, if possible. Do NOT back up your data onto your existing C: drive, as if you somehow delete your C: drive during installation of Linux, your backup will be deleted too.
- **CPU type:** When downloading Linux, ensure to select the correct build for your CPU. Many distributions have separate downloads for 32-bit or 64-bit CPU architectures - they also may have downloads for non-X86 CPUs. If you're migrating from Windows, you'll likely want X86, 32-bit or 64-bit.
- **Dual-booting:** if you want to keep your Windows install, you can do that by using ""dual boot"", where you select which OS you want to use from a menu when you first power on the machine. This topic is a bit complex for this post, so we recommend making a post about it if you have queries (you could try [this search](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/search?q=dual+boot&restrict_sr=on) too). Dual-boot (sometimes called multi-boot) is a good way to experiment. However, you will need to have sufficient diskspace to hold both operating systems at once.
- **Drivers:** This can get tricky, especially for newer, consumer-grade hardware. If you find a problem here, please make a post about it so we can assist. Using a live CD can show up problems here before you spend time on a full install.
- **Applications:** Linux does not natively support Windows programs, so you'll need to find a ""workalike"" for each Windows application you use. You can also try [Wine](https://winehq.org/), which lets some Windows applications run on unix-like systems, including Linux. However this may not work for your particular needs, you'll need to test it to see. There is a compatibility list [here](https://appdb.winehq.org/). If you have DOS apps, try [DOSbox](http://www.dosbox.com/) or [DOSEMU](http://www.dosemu.org/). It's also possible to ""virtualize"" your Windows install, using software such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), and run it in a window under Linux.
- **Secure boot:** newer machines have a feature which can prevent non-Windows operating systems from booting. You may need to disable Secure Boot in your BIOS if your hardware has this feature.

- Internet Explorer - Firefox, Chrome, or [Seamonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/) (not as common as the other two, but it does look more like Internet Explorer)
- Office - [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), [OpenOffice](http://openoffice.org/)

- Windows Media Player - [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/) (you can get a [skin](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/skins.php?sort=downloads) if you'd like).
- Paint - [mtPaint](http://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/) is pretty close. There's also GIMP, but it's much more complicated.
- Silverlight - [Pipelight](http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html) and a user-agent switcher will let you use Silverlight-based websites on Linux.
- Flash - The last version of Flash player is 11.2. To get the latest Flash, you can either use Chrome, or install Flash player through Pipelight.

Note that you should use your package manager to install programs, instead of downloading them from websites.

**Migrating your data:**

- Copy your personal files onto a USB drive.
- Backup your browser profile onto the USB drive too so you can restore your bookmarks. This will only work if you will use the same browser. If you're changing browsers, try using the import feature of your new browser to restore your old bookmarks.
- User data on Windows XP computers is usually found in the locations below:

| item | location
| ---|---
| Desktop|C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Desktop 
| Favorites (Internet Explorer)|C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Favorites
| My Documents|C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\My Documents (note: the Downloads, Music, My Pictures, My Videos collections subdirectories may be large) 
| Contacts (Outlook Express)|C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Microsoft\Address Book
| Contacts (Outlook)|N/A - is contained in the PST
| email (Outlook Express)|C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Local Settings\Application Data\Identities\XXXXX\Microsoft\Outlook Express (where XXXXX is a long string of alphanumeric characters)
| email (Outlook 2003)|C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook

Notes: 

- This list is *not* complete - it covers the standard locations for popular software only.
- Each user on a Windows XP machine has a separate profile, these are all stored in the *C:\Documents and Settings* directory. Ensure to copy the data for each profile on the system.
- Some directories (eg. Application Data) may be hidden, to browse to them, first enable ""show hidden files and folders"" (not detailed here).

**Migration tips:**

- When you're installing, try and have access to a second computer with a working internet connection. If you run into problems during the install, you can use the other computer to search for a solution.
- If you encounter problems, don't forget to try any ""test installation media"", ""test memory"" and/or ""test hard disk"" options you may be offered.
- Use the same wallpaper on your new Linux installation, it'll help make the transition easier.

linux4noobs,"So I have been teaching myself the basics of linux and bash commands and somehow accidentally created a file named ""--help"". I have been trying to remove it for some time now with the rm command and short of removing the entire directory the file sits in I am all out of ideas.

The commands I tried include:

$ rm \*

$ rm \*help

$ rm \*hel\*

$ rm --help

$ rm \\-\\-help

$ rm \\-\\-\\help

They all produce the same result. They bring up the help page for the rm function. Any ideas how I can remove the file? Thanks.

Edit: The solution is either:

$ rm -- --help

or

$ rm ./--help"
linux4noobs,"I've been a Linux user full-time on my home PC for almost a year now, and I just want to encourage new Linux users, to take the time to learn some Linux basics, at least learning how to install and remove packages using the terminal. It really isn't as difficult as you might think.

I wanted to share a story about what happened to me this morning that made me glad I learned just a little bit about how the terminal works. I was removing some font packages that were automatically installed with Cinnamon desktop that are for non-Latin alphabets, that I would never ever use, and just clog up my font list in LibreOffice. Well, apparently removing one of those packages caused several dependencies to also be removed and I was being quite careless, and it turned out those dependencies were integral to the functioning of my desktop, so much so that in the middle of my terminal session, the desktop stopped functioning, the screen turned black and the computer went back to the boot screen.

I booted and lo and behold, all that would display was a black screen with blocky white letters asking me to enter my username and password. Basically I had no graphical desktop, I just had access to a terminal. 8 months ago, heck, even 2 months ago, I would have freaked out, probably grabbed my USB and just re-installed my OS, erasing all my data. But, because I had taken the time to learn a few commands I was able to calmly learn a few things. 

First I logged in and executed a list command (ls) to see whether I had lost any of my files or if this was a desktop issue. Luckily I saw all my folders intact. Next I was able to run neofetch, which is a program I installed which displays information about your system along with a logo in terminal (its pretty neat). Everything looked ok, but there was no desktop environment listed. So it just came down to having to reinstall the desktop, which I was able to do by running the simple install command and installing Cinnamon desktop again. 

After rebooting, the desktop came back online and amazingly was even still configured exactly as I left it.

By knowing 2 basic commands I was able to correct a small mistake that seemed huge. So I really encourage new users to take the time how to do a few basic things in the terminal in the event that something like accidentally breaking your desktop environment happens, you can confidently and proudly correct it."
linux4noobs,"-What the hell? How the hell? How does anything work and why do I have to do so much command line stuff? 

-Oh ok this isn't so bad, I'm learning something new! Pretty easy, lots of guides online. 

-Why doesn't this piece of hardware just do what I want? 

-Ok that's working, now I've broken something else. 

-Fixed all the problems, now to start using my system! 

-Oh, I'm missing this dependency for a program I want. 

-Looks like the dependency has a dependency. Ok. 

-Application I wanted is installed. It doesn't work. 

-TROUBLESHOOTING 

-Ok my stuff is working how I want. Now to fine tune things. 

-I broke something that was working fine while fiddling. Can't remember the last thing I did before it stopped working. 

-Try to fix it, Linux won't boot properly anymore. 

-Timeshift x 18591030 because a ""fix"" makes things worse. 

-Screw it, clean install. I'll try again with a clean slate. 

-Repeat about 7 times so far. 

I love Linux. It makes you work for what you want.

linux4noobs,I didn't know this for the longest time and It has sped things up so much. You can also do the same for copying.
linux4noobs,"I have to prelude this by saying that I consider myself a generally competent end user.  I was raised in an OS-9 household and made the transition to Windows in middle school because I wanted to get in on some of that sweet Monkey Island action.  I know the install location of every program on my personal PC, I always run as Admin if the software doesn't work the first time, and I know how to google error codes and follow step-by-step instructions to make registry edits.  I don't really understand what's going on under the hood of my OS at any given time, but I am circumspect enough to do general troubleshooting.  For the most part, my computer and I get along fine.

That said, I've become more peripherally aware in the last year or so of the sort of money-grubbing bullshit Microsoft pulls (I know, I know; I'm young) and the bizarre, arbitrary restrictions they put on how users are allowed to use the OS.  The philosophy behind Linux is so comparatively enticing, even if for all practical purposes I really don't have the skills or interest to utilize the customization capabilities myself.  It's free, after all, so why not give Linux a try?  

And, I mean, I did.  But even aside from the part where I managed to destroy my laptop's hard drive doing so (long story, not Mint's fault), I've left the experiment feeling very discouraged.

The thing I keep noticing over and over is that every guide which calls itself an ""intro to Linux"" or ""Linux for normal people"" or even ""Linux for Windows users"" seems geared toward users who are prepared to do deep work tinkering the OS itself (Bash, GNU, etc) rather than use the GUI as it's given.  Most of these guides start off with how to navigate the directory through the terminal, FFS.  I know it's a valuable skill to have, but I care a lot more about first learning to navigate the directory from the *desktop.*  

I do not do network administration or development or coding.  Neither am I the sort of user who only checks their email and browses the internet.  I have a few particular programs I use very frequently (Manga Studio, MusicBee, Scrivener, a handful of non-AAA games) and my goal is to be able to continue to use them; I'm a simple woman.  I understand how the path through the Windows directory works, and I know how installation ties into that - you find a location in Program Files [(x86)] and there you put your executable and all related files, probably with a shortcut to the desktop.  If you want to keep backups for the save files of a game, find the default or custom location for those files and store them on an external drive or the cloud.  It comes very naturally after so many years using a PC.  Finding a simple but thorough ""compare and contrast"" introductory guide, however, one which uses Windows as a practical reference point for understanding Linux (""you're used to having a C: drive, but Linux doesn't use that.  Instead, we have the root directory..."") has been surprisingly difficult.  I know that trying to understand one OS as a variation on the other isn't how you come to really comprehend how it works, but it would make me feel much steadier on my feet starting out.  It seems to me that those more foundational skills should come later.

Stupidly simple example question: Linux doesn't use .exe files, so does it have a direct equivalent?  Is there a default install location for software a la Program Files? If not, what does it do upon installing a new program instead?  How the heck does the whole process work?  And why am I struggling to find an easy-to-understand answer to this question?

I don't know.  If you've made it this far into my long whine, you may be thinking that if the only reason I'm interested in moving to Linux is to make a statement, then it's really not for me, and that may very well be right.  I suppose I just wish that the community didn't keep throwing out the line that Linux is for everybody these days, and then begin every stable distro's introductory guide with how to navigate your files without a mouse.  Of course, if I have any fundamental misunderstandings about this, please say so.  I really am interested -- just overwhelmed.  Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I really appreciate the feedback from everyone here.  I haven't had a chance to respond to every post, but I'm reading all of it.  You're all so encouraging!"
linux4noobs,"Last week, my CS professor gave us a crash course in web development. I mainly use a windows laptop for electrical engineering purposes (and my school really only supports windows...) and tried to follow the assignment as instructed for windows machines. For some reason, I couldn’t ever get it to work after hours of tinkering and debugging. 

Then, I remembered I had an old laptop with a lubuntu image on it that I haven’t used in months, and made explicitly for situations like this. 

Installing everything I needed was easy, and doing the assignment itself wasn’t that easy, but at least I could actually DO the assignment. Everything just worked out of he box without too much setup.

linux4noobs,"Guys...I did it! I solved a problem!

I've been banging my head against the wall for days now trying to figure out how to get my wireless card working on my PC. It's been frustrating and annoying and I was about to just say ""screw it"" and go back to cozy-old Windows where everything magically seems to work all the time.

But then...I figured it out. It took a LOT of reading and a LOT of learning and about two dozen dead-ends, but I finally figured out what I needed to do to make it work! And I think I finally see what really attracts those die-hard Linux fans to the system:

You get mental atrophy working with Windows or OS X because you're essentially in the passenger's seat the whole time. But with Linux, you control your own destiny. If something doesn't work then it's on you to improvise, adapt, and overcome. It's certainly not for everybody. Some people don't want to problem-solve their own computer. But I'm an engineer. I like puzzles. I like solving problems and I love learning. So...maybe this whole Linux thing isn't so bad after all!

&#x200B;

**Edit:** You're right - I should've included more information as breadcrumbs for the next poor soul who has to deal with this. So here goes...

# Backstory

I'm in the middle of distro-hopping. I tried Mint and didn't care for it much. I can't really put my finger on why I didn't like it...it just didn't click. I then went to Ubuntu and, while it was better, I ended up having a fairly large problem where I couldn't burn CDs/DVDs at all. Trying to research that problem ultimately lead me to believe that it was caused by Mercury in retrograde or something because there was absolutely no one else that seemed to have the problem I was having (I ended up buying a new burner which worked). In both of these distributions, however, installation was a breeze. I was able to connect to wifi right out of the box and everything was hunky-dory. I brazenly took this for granted and just assumed that all distributions would work this way...

I was so young and naive back then...

After that CD/DVD debacle, I decided it was time to move on from Ubuntu and try Fedora. And then...

# The Problem

Broadcom wireless network adapters are apparently notorious for not working with Linux. Their drivers are proprietary and, apparently for moral reasons, most Linux distributions won't ship with some of their drivers ""out of the box."" Not all Broadcom adapters, mind you. Just a select few. You can (and should) search the internet for your specific network adapter to determine compatibility before installing Linux. Lesson learned there! I searched after the fact and came across [this list](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#Supported_devices). Turns out, my network adapter, BCM4360, is pretty firmly in the ""not supported"" column. That was fun to discover *after* I already installed Fedora.

# Problem-Solving Efforts

Off to the internets I went! I scoured forum after forum using every combination of ""Broadcom, BCM4360, Fedora"" I could think of. Most solutions involved connecting your computer to the internet, downloading some community-created drivers, and installing them yourself. The irony of having to connect to the internet to install drivers which would allow you to connect to the internet was not lost on me by any means. This is where I got to learn the joys of dependencies...

I set up my internet-connected laptop right next to my ""involuntarily air-gapped"" desktop and got to work. From the laptop, I downloaded an RPM package which allegedly had the right drivers, copied it to a USB drive, plugged that drive into my desktop, copied the RPM file over, and tried to install it - only to have it fail because I needed to install another RPM file first. So I went back to the laptop, downloaded the other RPM file, copied it over, tried to install it...and it failed again because - yup - needed I other files first. Wash-rinse-repeat.

I think I was 4 RPM dependents in before I gave up on Fedora. OpenSUSE was the next distro on my list to try, so I did a quick search to make sure Broadcom drivers were included. That's when I came across this little gem from opensuse-guide.org:

>The Linux kernel comes with the brcm80211 driver by default... If you experience problems with the above driver...you may want to try installing the proprietary broadcom-wl driver (package: *broadcom-wl*) available in the Packman software repository.

Well I took that to mean that, like Ubuntu, it wasn't available ""by default"" *but* it was just a checkbox away, so I didn't worry about it.

WRONG!

Turns out that, like Fedora, the drivers were nowhere to be found. Back to the RPMs.

# The False-Hope Solution

Fortunately, the OpenSUSE community seemed to be more helpful than the Fedora community in terms of developing and distributing the necessary drivers. Finding the right RPM files went much faster. And, unlike Fedora, there were apparently only two that I needed ([here's the link](https://software.opensuse.org/package/broadcom-wl) to one of them - I can't remember where the other one is, but you should be able to find it quickly on the same website once you know what dependent you need). But then...probably just out of spite...I found that these files were created by M. C. Esher. You see...RPM #2 was a dependent of RPM #1 ***but*** RPM #1 was also a dependent of RPM #2. Damn! But then I remembered something I saw on a forum back when I was dealing with this in Fedora: instead of installing the RPMs one at a time, I should be able to just type:

`sudo rpm -ivh *.rpm`

And the system should install *all* RPMs in the directory together. Well wouldn't you know it - it worked! At least...they installed. Still no internet. ""Maybe I just need to reboot,"" I thought to myself. So I did and voila! It found my Broadcom network card! I was saved! Except...I couldn't connect to wifi.

This was it. This was my low-point. I had two tabs open on my laptop. One of them searching for some last-ditch hope to solve my problem and the other going to Microsoft's website to download an ISO of the Windows 10 installer. I scrolled hopelessly through Google to try and find something - *anything* \- that might work, but with a heavy sigh, I clicked the dreaded ""2"" button in the search results. But then...then I found something.

# The Real Solution!

I found [a thread](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/cannot-setup-wifi-in-opensuse-leap-42-3-a-4175617838/) with just 5 posts on it. The u/jradio610 of a couple days ago would have just ignored it and moved on. But desperate times called for desperate measures. The fourth post of this thread stated that the OP had fixed their problem with the command:

`sudo mkinitrd`

Now, I know enough to know you don't just go around typing random commands into the terminal - especially when prefixed with sudo. And a quick search for mkinitrd just said that the command ""creates initial ramdisk images for preloading modules"" which might as well have said that it ""configures the flux capacitor for maximizing kilohenry output."" But again, desperate times. Besides...what's the worst that could happen? If I bricked my system, I would just reinstall Windows. All my data was backed up and offsite, so I had nothing to lose. I pulled up a terminal, typed in the command, hit enter, and rebooted.

And it fucking worked."
linux4noobs,"Its an SSD.  About 15 seconds into realizing what happened I pulled the power cord because I know every second of  continued use would overwrite my files.  I havnt turned it back on since.  I have live boot USB's.  I'm posting this from my phone.  I havnt googled solutions yet, I'm posting here first thing.  Trying not to freak out."
linux4noobs,"First of all I want to thank everyone who supported me, and everyone who told me my mistakes.

I'm UniqUnic and I'm bringing you guide on switching to Linux.

# Why and how did I switch to Linux, should you too?

Nowadays  there are only two major operating systems available for our computers,  Windows OS and Mac OS X, and honestly I’ve been using both of them for  quite a long time. One day, suddenly I’ve realized that Windows and OS X  are both full of **bloatware**  which I find really annoying, primarily because I like everything to be  perfectly aligned in the order I want it to be. After a little bit of  googling on the internet I’ve found many interesting operating systems  which were available for me, but none of them seemed as a long term  project which will continue to grow, except a few similar ones. From my  computer experience I’ve been listening to people talking about Linux  Kernel, but I didn’t want to know much about it. Time has passed, and  I’ve finally picked one which I liked. And it’s name is **Ubuntu**.  I know that many people are going to complain about my choice, which is  probably the most common one, but don’t get me wrong, Fedora and  Mint(another Ubuntu, I know) would have made me satisfied if they had  more appealing user interface. And here the journey begins.

## Preparing for a switch

I  couldn’t listen to people talking about Virtual Machines running Linux  as it is not what I wanted. I knew it wasn’t able to handle neither 3D  nor 2D game development and design. I’ve started diving into deep waters  straight from the beginning. Since I’m a programmer, as I’ve mentioned  earlier, I’m used to running both Windows and Mac OS. Therefore I had to  use a dual-boot computer as my daily driver, which I enjoyed. So I did  have a lot of dual-booting, triple-booting or even quad-booting  experience. I downloaded one third party USB Disk creation tool and put  an ISO onto it and went through installer step by step. I thought I was  up and running, there is only a few other software left to install, yet  the simplest thing in my life, huh. No. Lots of things were going bad  from the start. WiFi is working, I suppose, well at least there is icon  indicating it on the top, well it kinda works. OK, I say, maybe it’s my  adapter so I’ll have some trouble in future, but who cares, I think,  there’s a whole lot of new stuff to figure out. At this point I hope  that all the necessary software is installed, like on my Mac or Windows.

## Whole, lot trouble in front of me

I’ve  tried to use my PC but I see something is going wrong, I’ve got a  $1,500 worth PC and it can’t even play a 720p video. I’ve messed up  something for sure. I test my WiFi speed an it’s 1.5 megabit per second,  wow, I say it can’t be, on OS X it is nearly ten times faster! I’ve got  to fix this, I say. I google up a bit on the internet and find out that  I’ve got one of the least supported adapters which is knows for being  messy. OK, I’ll try some online guides. I’m going all over the internet  and trying, trying, trying… But no use. It seems as if my Linux journey  is coming to an end. And from nowhere I get an e-mail that my Ubuntu  Forum Thread has finally gotten a reply. And he is able to solve my  problem using open source drivers. Yup, I’ve finally got good internet  speeds, let’s give Youtube a try. Now 720p videos play, kinda, there’s a  lot of lag in them. Oh, I see! My GPU driver is not installed, let’s  fix it. I open up AMD website, look up my HD6970 and I find some  downloadable .tar.gz files. OK, some more troubleshooting and I’ve found  the install.sh file. I run through the wizard and it fails with some  stupid error (AMD, don’t be shit). Well, I guess I’ll need some open  source drivers I guess. I find some Barts drivers and install them and I  get pretty good results, obviously not as good as on Windows or OS X,  but pretty close. Now, my computer is able to handle both 3D and 2D  rendering which is great! Now, I’m more of a private guy so I try to set  up a DNS server, but it again ain’t work. Brhhh, I hate you Linux! But  again after some troubleshooting, changing repositories and installing  different WiFi manager app I get it to work.

## Installing the important software

Now,  that I’ve met Linux a bit, I know that it’s not like Windows, which  provides you with installation wizards, but more like a database  including all needed software in repositories. I got used to it and I’m  starting to like it :). Now it’s time to throw some software on it.  After a little time, I got all of my daily apps installed, which  included VLC Media Player, Libre Office, Firefox and Addons, Filezilla  and some other apps. Now it’s time to start building apps and games, I  say. I open Unity website and look for Unity 3 installer, but there is  no Linux option. Somewhere on the internet I find Unity installer which  was ported to Linux and download it as .deb file. Everything is up and  running except my graphics apps. I’m more of the **Adobe**  guy, so I liked Adobe CS4 Master Collection, eventually I realized that  it’s not available on Linux. Remember running .exe on OS X? Well **Wine**  runs in ans saves the day again! Installing and activating Adobe apps  isn’t much of a deal and Illustrator, Photoshop, Fireworks and  Dreamwaver are here. Again, as with benchmarks, performance isn’t  perfect but can still do the job. Finally I’ve gotten all of the needed  apps with the exception for Visual Studio which hasn’t been ported to  neither Mac nor Linux, and situation for Linux hasn’t changed today  (unlike with Mac).

## Customizing Ubuntu, making it kinda appealing

Back  in the days, Windows was customizable, with a little bit of tweaking  registry you could have made it just the way you wanted, unlike today.  Linux was more of OS which was just starting to gain fame, even though  it was over ten years old. Ubuntu lacked in app themes, icon packs,  shell themes etc. I’ve found some wallpapers online and made them  shuffle on the desktop again with the help of open source apps. Icon  packs were available but I found them more beautiful than on windows,  because of unity’s squared icons, so everything seemed nice and clean.  Lack of animations made me a proud Linux user, as everything felt  snappier than on other platforms. The only problem that I really had,  was that my desktop was zoomed in a bit, not much but about 3–4 pixels. I  found a solution in terminal and even though my monitor had a bit of  the black bars it was better.

## Learning Shell

Terminal,  your Linux’ best friend is basically like a command prompt if you’ve  never used Unix based OS like Mac OS. It wasn’t much of a change for me,  because I’ve had some Terminal knowledge but actually on my Mac Pro, I  used mostly Windows. I had to get used to using **sudo** (windows calls it Admin), apt, dpkg, git etc. If you’re planning to switch to Linux, the best way of preparing would be **Chocolatey**.  If you have ever used Sublime Text, you will probably know what I’m  talking about. Most of the users won’t need to know many commands, only  about fifteen commands. There’s also a good blog that covers many topics  about Linux called **It’sFOSS**, which I highly recommend.

## What I got after switching to Linux

At  first it seemed as a completely new but useless experience as most of  the things I’ve been doing were able to be done on Windows or Mac OS,  but after some time I got to like some things about Linux. First of all  and one of the key things, it’s completely **free** and **open-source**  (except for some of distros). This feature really stands out in the  world of operating systems. There is source available for many apps and  operating systems, so you can customize them just the way you want and  be able to pack them into an ISO disk image, which I really appreciate,  so that all of my software can come preinstalled. Another useful thing  is that as a tech geek I’ve come across many risky websites. I’ve gotten  viruses or malware from there sometimes on Windows even though I can  recognize them and delete them immediately, but on Linux situation is a  bit different. Virus software is unable to make any mess without root  permission, which I must grant it, therefore it can’t damage my  operating system. Throughout the years, Linux has gotten great app  support for developers and designers, and all of them are stored in one  place. Apps like Visual Studio Code, Atom Text Editor, Android Studio  and many more are stored in Snaps library and those can be easily  installed within 2–3 commands. Another great thing which I like about  Linux is **no existence of installation wizards**.  I know that Wizards help newbies in installation process, but  disagreeing and agreeing with bunch of stupid statements and installing  bloatware is waste of time for me. Linux has also become my Home Server.  I can share all of my photos, videos, documents, downloads etc. It has  become like a cloud server with a few lifetime terabytes of storage.  Linux has also fixed my **HDD** boot times, as it is quite a lightweight operating system, so that I don’t need to store OS on my SSD.

## What I miss in Linux

Personally,  I’ve been a fanboy for many years. At first I really liked Apple, after  that I started to like Microsoft and I’ve become a Linux fanboy in last  couple of years. I’ve made many compromises when using Linux and have  switched from many industry standard software to free alternatives, but  still there are some software packages that can’t be changed. Wine has  made my Linux life a lot easier but still **Video Editing**  software hasn’t been ported to Linux. Adobe Premiere always fails to  render and Magix (primarily Sony) Vegas hasn’t still been ported to  Wine. There are still some alternative software available fir you such  as DaVinci Resolve and Kdenlive. DaVinci Resolve has been used for color  correction in the film industry for quite a long time now and now it  packs more features focused on professional video editing. My all time  best IDE Visual Studio can’t manage to run in virtual machine nor Wine.  Therefore I still have to use Windows to run it in dual boot. Another  big minus in Linux is no existence of **.NET**  framework, but Mono project which doesn’t seem nearly as functional as  Microsoft’s option. Another tool I miss is a MPC-HC which is in my  opinion one of the best media players, which produces the best colors in  video playback.

## Should you switch to Linux?

Usually  at this point people will tell you that it is totally up to you and  that they can’t know answer to questions of this type. I’m going to give  you a few tips that will help you with making your choice. First of all  you should decide whether you want to install Linux on the computer you  already own or buy a new PC. If your choice is to install it on  computer you already own, I recommend looking up drivers online before  starting an installation. If your PC uses Intel HD graphics or Nvidia  graphics chip, low DPI monitor and Ethernet cable, you are already good  to go, whereas if your PC uses **AMD graphics card**, **high DPI** monitor and **Wireless**  adapter you should look them up in this way : Series name for GPU (for  example Turks), Monitor Model and Wireless Adapter Chip (for exaple  Rtl8192 not Netis 2116). Otherwise if you choice is to buy new PC, don’t buy PC made for Windows, look for parts that are Linux supported.Once  you’ve found out that your parts are Linux supported, you should pick  right distribution for you. Some of most popular and most supported are  Linux Mint, Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Arc Linux, Parrot Linux,  Puppy Linux etc. For a system administrator I would recommend going for a  Linux Mint, for developers Ubuntu or Arc, for lower powered PCs Lubuntu  or Puppy Linux, for those who care for privacy Parrot is my No. 1.If you plan mostly **gaming**  on Linux, the solution has been released recently. There is a tool on  GitHub called DXVK. It is still not that stable, but stable enough to  run most titles in Wine.**Cross-platform app developers** shouldn’t switch to Linux in my opinion as it doesn’t support leading frameworks, but if you plan to do **Javascript**, **Ruby**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Java** or even **C#**  game development I would highly recommend it. There are all of the  needed tools, you can run your databases and secure them much easier  then on Windows or Mac.What about **hacking**?  Well short answer, yes and no. Hacking is quite complex and not  everybody can be hacker. Linux is a good base for starting hacking. **Debian** and any other Debian based operating system can be used for this purpose, but many people recommend **Kali Linux** or **Parrot Linux**.  This choice is often made because they come bundled with many  “security” software which will be used for hacking :). Now many of you  will download and install Kali, but you are not hackers, there’s a long  way in front of you, I would recommend learning how Databases and  Networking work but programming knowledge can come in handy. You must  always remember that online guides will teach you useful skills, but  taking down a website will take quite some time of studying, huh.**HTPC (Home Theater Personal Computer)** can  run pretty well on Linux based operating system. If you plan on  building a home theater personal computer, I would suggest also building  a home server. There you will be able to store all of your “legally”  downloaded movies, music, photos etc. It also has wide support of HTPC  apps like **Kodi**.**Mining on Linux?**  Mining has become a trend in last few years and it is an interesting  topic, but on Linux… I don’t think so. Graphics units are currently the  most profitable way of mining and many of them have worse performance  than on Windows, so if profit is your main goal than avoid Linux. Mining  a less popular coin may sound interesting to you, so in this case Linux  is your best friend, as many developers start small nowadays on **GitHub**.

## Conclusion

Linux  is a user friendly operating system which is trying to get its  attention, but maybe it’s time just hasn’t come yet. Power users may  find it difficult that there are no their favorite apps, but still there  are free alternatives which may fit your needs. Switching to it made me  a favor, as there are no more annoying Windows apps which many of you  didn’t even know existed, so I’m finally free of bloatware.If you found this article helpful please consider sharing and commenting and as always keep safe until next time :).I  want to thank all of you who supported me on Reddit r/Linux4Noobs and I  want to give big thanks to people who made this article possible : [u/Wojakusesarch](https://www.reddit.com/user/Wojakusesarch) | [u/aikilink](https://www.reddit.com/user/aikilink) | [u/frankandgalculator](https://www.reddit.com/user/frankandgalculator) | [u/metmike07](https://www.reddit.com/user/metmike07) | [u/redditandom](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditandom/) | [u/Cactoos](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cactoos/) | [u/tdreampo](https://www.reddit.com/user/tdreampo/) | [u/takethecannoli4](https://www.reddit.com/user/takethecannoli4)"

# Useful Linux apps you probably haven’t heard about

A  while ago, I joined many Linux communities. Unlike on Windows ones,  people usually mentioned apps and software, that many of us have heard  of. These sequences of answers came across my email, repeatedly every  once or twice a week. It started to get strange how people didn’t  discover many software available in repositories so today I’m bringing  you useful apps and software **for Linux** you probably haven’t heard of.

## Pixeluvo

Pixeluvo  is an image manipulation tool available for Windows and Linux. It packs  many powerful tools which are included in Photoshop and on top of them  adds premade Instagram like filters except these have more of control  options. Many of you may say that GIMP has already made Linux users a  favor by packing most of Photoshop features, but if you are more of an  amateur who does like touched up photos, but doesn’t like spending much  time on it, this is a perfect choice for you.

## Shutter

Shutter  is a free and easy to use app for taking screenshots of your Linux  desktop. It has a user friendly interface it is perfect choice for  people who like taking shots of certain parts of pages. It can also  automatically select certain windows and elements of documents, web  pages or books. Shutter is one of the most powerful and lightweight apps  for this purpose.

## CrococryptFile

Crococrypt  is one simplest encryption tools but at the same time rich in features  you will most likely need. It covers many encryption suites such as :  password-based, PGP-based, AES-256 based etc. Crococrypt is also easy to  use and has a flat style interface without any confusing info, average  users won’t need. It also includes its own file type called .croco.

## Epiphany

Now  this one is a bit more popular than others on this list, but at the  same time worth mentioning. This is a web browser which is basically  Safari for Mac OS. It is lightweight, fast and secure and doesn’t pack  nearly any extensions. If you’ve ever wondered of great Linux browser,  that will allow you to browse internet freely, without browser  collecting info about your computer, well this is option you should go  for.

## Soundnode

Haven’t  heard of SoundCloud? Well you’re probably living in 1900s. Many of  SoundCloud users have probably tried to find a desktop app, which allows  you to use all of its functionalities, well it is pretty hard. Luckily  there is a project going around which tends to allow Linux users to use  SoundCloud as an actual app, and its name is Soundnode. It has a nice  and clean dark user interface which is easy to navigate. Even though it  doesn’t have all of the functionalities SoundCloud Web App has, it can  handle most of your daily tasks you throw at it.

## MPC-HC

This  one is more of Windows exclusive app, but Wine handles it almost  perfectly. MPC-HC is a media player which uses Codecs that are the  opposite of ones that VLC uses. MPC is by far the best media player you  can find. It supports many file types and colors are the closest result  to the original you can get. After a bit of testing you’ll realize that  VLC tends to produce warmer colors.

## LMMS

Ever  heard of Fruity Loops Studio? Well LMMS is trying to produce the same  result as FL Studio when it comes to making beats. With nineteen built  in instruments, you’ll be able to produce beats like never before. It  also includes some audio editing features like different charts,  equalization and normalization and there are plenty of plugins as it is  open source. It also includes FX Mixer, Keyboard (PC or Midi) support  and some sound effects like Kick, Clap, Snare etc.

## Ramme

Love  Instagram? Well this is a perfect solution for you. Ramme is an app  which packs all of the Instagram features into one desktop app. It  supports two themes which are preinstalled, but you can customize their  code so they look different with a little programming knowledge. Ramme  is specifically know for its keyboard shortcuts and there are plenty of  those. Unfortunately Ramme is no longer maintained.

## GPaste

Have  you ever copied the URL of your MP3 converter site, closed a page and  than copied YouTube song URL. In that case you must be wondering, “Why  the hell did I do this ?”. Well there comes GPaste, a clipboard manager.  It can shorten your links with a little bit of tweaking and includes  settings for auto clearing history, saving data types and many more.  GPaste was specifically designed for Gnome3 but will work on many other  environments.

## RawTherapee

RawThreapee  is another Gnome image manipulation software, but completely different  from Pixeluvo. It is more like Lightroom for Linux. It packs many tools  and algorithms such as : demosaicing algorithms, hue and saturation,  white balance, exposure etc. It also supports RAW files just like  Lightroom and they both have similar interfaces.

## Angry Search

If  you’ve ever been using Windows, you would have heard of Search  Everything which is a great app. It stores data about your computer into  one file and than finds it easily. Well here’s a Linux app for that. It  also has many modes. Some show less, some show more info about files.  It also includes Hex search which is great.

## Flame Shot

Flame  Shot is another app for taking screenshots, but this one has really  nice interface with some features you won’t find in many other programs.  It includes manual delay settings, full screen or cropped captures,  markers, shapes, different colors, arrows etc. This app can be launched  both in GUI or without it.

## Etcher

Etcher  is a USB flashing tool. This is yet simple, but useful tool. It  includes simple interface with just a few buttons which is beautiful. It  claims to be faster about 50% that others, but actually you can’t be  sure. In some of my tests it was 70–72% faster than UNetBootin, whereas  in the others it was only 10–15% faster. It really depends on which file  you’re trying to flash. One thing which is outstanding it that it  recognizes hard drives, both internal and external. This way you can be  sure it won’t wipe your data.

## PacVim

If  you want to be a good programmer or developer, you are probably wanting  to switch to Vim. You might be wondering : “Well, it’s just another  text editor, isn’t it ?”. Well the answer is “No”. Because of its wide  language support and features it packs, it is quite hard to use and  understand for newbies, that’s where PacVim jumps in. PacVim is a game  which will teach you Vim commands. How do we achieve results? Simple,  ever played Pac-Man, well you are a green cursor (Pac-Man) who tries to  avoid red letter ‘G’, while attempting to highlight words.

## Devils pie

Devils  pie is another simple tool, which may help all of the multitaskers. It  allows you to set on which workspace will application open, what size  and in which state, when you click on its shortcut. Yup, simple as that.

## Rofi

Rofi  is a text based, programmable launcher. Rofi includes text interface  which will greet you with a set of commands which are stored in some  kind of folders. It includes many themes and supports UTF-8 and RTL.  Stuff it can do includes : Windows Launcher, Application Launcher, SSH  Launcher, DMenu replacement etc. It has fully configurable keyboard  navigation as well.

## PDFUnite

PDFUnite  is an application, which is ran in command line, where it ask you for  inputs of PDF file locations. After it gets locations, it merges them  into a single PDF… Well… That’s it :)

## Radio Tray

Radio  Tray is as its name suggests, program for for listening to radio. It  comes with a list of radio stations preconfigured but it’s also  extremely easy to add your own. You simply need the radio station URL  (quick search is usually all it takes) and then you click “configure  radios” to add it. The GUI is super neat and tidy and it lives in the  system tray on cinnamon beside the clock and other little applets. It is  far more superior than TuneIn radio which people usually recommend,  there are no ads, no clutter, nothing. Just a clean icon and a click.

## TimeShift

TimeShift  usually comes perinstalled nowadays, but in some distributions it can  come handy. It is an app for creating system restore points, and  restoring back to them. It automatically takes snapshots of file system  at regular intervals. Keep in mind that this app is completely different  from other system restore point apps. Its goal is not restoring user  files, but restoring only file system.

## PEEK

PEEK  is another simple but really great tool for all bloggers who make  HowTo’s on their computer or in those situations when you are sending a  bug report (it’s 2018 who does that ?). This app has a simple user  interface which is not much adjustable, but does the job. It supports  three file types : GIF, MP4 and WebM. You can also disable mouse clicks  and cursor. Keep in mind that GIF won’t work well without gifski codec.

linux4noobs,"Just wanted to share a positive experience. As the support for Windows 7 is running out, all my family admin PCs get now the Linux treatment - If anybody is going to Windows 10 they are on their own, or need to get a different ""administrator"".

So I sometimes get some old and cheap consumer hardware to support. One was a Brother DCP-195C a several year old printer/scanner and as ""consumer"" as one gets. Unluckily it is not supported via the kernel... So I had to install the driver manually. Which was a breeze:

* Searching for the model on the [support website](https://support.brother.com/g/b/productsearch.aspx?c=gb&lang=en&content=dl)
* Selecting ""Linux"" as OS and chosing between .deb and .rpm
* And here I just got the script ""Driver Install Tool""
* Starting the script with the model name as parameter
* (Pressing enter 5 times) - Done 

That was near to a Windows experience! Also what I liked is that there is also the option to individually get different drivers for the printer and scanner (in 32bit/64bit). So if something works well enough with the kernel drivers, one could choose only the missing.

I was really impressed to find that support for a 6 year old, 100 buck cheapo device from the next electronic retailer..."
linux4noobs,"One of my relatives is a nice old lady, who is not really fond of computers - But sees the need to use them, as to not get fully out of touch. She recently gave me a call that her computer (Windows 7) will be out of date soon according to a message on the screen...

Now I know her quite well and was certain that switching to Win 10 will give me a lot of calls, due to the UI adaptions. But I knew that Mint / Cinnamon is very similar to Win 7, so I proposed the following:

*""We will try Linux for a while and you tell me if you find your way around. We do it in a way that you can always switch back to Windows, if you need to get something done quickly, by yourself. If everything works out, we'll install it for good later on.""*

Technically I provided her with a persistent live-USB Mint for now - If she needs to go to Windows she can simply switch the computer off, remove the stick, and reboot. 

This was 3 weeks ago: So far I got no call in which she asked for adhoc support. Curiously I asked her for her experience yesterday: She is missing her bank (the shortcut to the website on the desktop) and is wondering that her USB stick doesn't show up if she puts it in (I deactivated the function, to not confuse her with the additional icon). Reading emails, writing letters and surfing the internet works flawlessly for her....

Sorry I heard that this works with non-computersavy folks, but I never believed it... Maybe the persistent USB drive idea can help other ""family-admins"", to experience the magic!"
linux4noobs,"Since you guys mostly appreciated my article about systemd, I thought I share this one as well.

I remember when I first tried to learn about virtualization I felt kind of overwhelmed by the amount of information, technical terms and cross references which constantly made me jump around between sources.

I focused on building a basic understanding step by step for complete noobs.
You should be able to read it from A to Z without googling anything or look up definitions. 
Basically no previous knowledge is necessary what so ever, you should know how to use Linux, for example open up a terminal, create a directory etc.

I hope some guys find it useful and you're fine with me posting my stuff here, no adds on my blog.

Have a nice day

linux4noobs,"For months I thought my computer was at its end. I was running Windows 10 and it was taking ages to boot up, not just to the log in screen but to actually load up a program once it ""started up"". Multi-tasking had become a joke and for some strange reason loading the first website after starting either Chrome or Firefox always took longer than subsequent loads. It just felt so ""heavy"" and everything seemed like it was just barely chugging along.

This computer is around 5 to 6 years old, its technology is probably older -- i5 4th gen, 4 GB of RAM, NVIDIA GT 740M. I figured it was breaking down and decided to start looking for a new one. In the process, I figured since I'd be replacing this one soon, I'd just install Lubuntu (being a lightweight distro and all) to see if things would be any different. I had zero expectations anything would change. I figured everything was a hardware problem.

And holy cow was I completely wrong. This thing works like its brand new! I can finally do multiple things at once. I can finally run some of those heavy applications that took ages to load on Windows 10; they now load in seconds on Lubuntu! I thought I'd have driver issues but nope, everything worked right out of the box! And I'm not sure if I can't recall correctly or whether this is actually happening but it feels like my Internet's a lot faster on Linux too. I'm pretty sure my download speeds are much higher than normal.

I have seriously reconsidered getting a new computer because it certainly feels like I already have one. I cannot believe Windows 10 was weighing it down so much. For a long time, I've hesitated making a complete switch to Linux but I think this is it. I might miss Microsoft Office, but I'll learn how to make the most of Libre Office and the Google Suite.

I know all of this sounds absurd and it probably sounds like I've discovered a new religion or something but I'm so glad I won't have to spend hundreds of dollars on a new machine and I can just enjoy this one for some time more."

OK, I am going away for the long weekend and won't be near an internet connection for 5 days, but really wanted to post this for [everyone that seemed really exicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/87ha47/tutorial_offer_would_anyone_be_interested_in_a/) for this. It's a little rough and not proof read, or formatted as cleanly as I would like. ( I will do this when I am back. But it *should* be accurate *or close enough* for now).

**Noob-2-Nerd Tutorial : OpenVPN in AWS with Dynamic DNS on a Headless Ubuntu Server**

^^Totally ^^need ^^a ^^catchier ^^name 

**Introduction:**

This tutorial aims to teach and prcatice Linux administration skills whilst making a functional private VPN server. We will be using and learning about [Amazon Web Services \(AWS\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services), [Ubuntu server 16.04](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_\(operating_system\)), [Dynamic DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS), and [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN).

 This tutorial will cover:

* What is AWS and what are [EC2 instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud)
* How to to configure a virtual headless Ubuntu 16.04 server on AWS's [free hosting tier.](https://aws.amazon.com/free/faqs/)
* How to open ports in AWS's virtual firewall
* How to install and configure OpenVPN server
* How to configure Dynamic DNS
* How to install the OpenVPN client 
* Using [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_\(text_editor\)) and  to manually edit the ovpn file to work on Ubuntu as well as other config files
* How to set aliases in [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_\(Unix_shell\))
* How to configure your [ssh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) preferences
* and a few other bits

**Prerequisites**

* A very basic understanding of how a terminal works.
* A computer with an internet connection. Preferably Ubuntu or Debian based.
* An ssh client. (For Windows users see [KiTTY](https://www.fosshub.com/KiTTY.html) - a fork of PuTTY but with more features and is still being updated.)
* A credit/debit card. Don't worry, you won't be charged (if you stick to the free tier), Amazon uses it to verify your identity.
* A phone for Amazon to verify you more.

**My Philosophy** (Optional reading)

I love Linux. It is my daily driver and for a living I am a Linux/Windows Sysadmin and desktop support. I do things my way and unless someone can give me a good reason to do it differently, I'm doing it the way I like it because what does it matter how I get from A to B? A lot of Linux purists, particually on the sysadmin side will critize your choice in text editor, choosing GUI over CLI, your desktop environment and anything else. Well, boohoo for them. I use vim, but if you like nano, go ahead and nano away. I like Budgie, but f you like Unity, use Unity. Do it how you like it.

In this tutorial, I will be demonstrating with vim text editor, but emacs or nano or whatever else will work just as fine. Some of the commands will be a bit different but I am sure you will figure it out. 

If you are unsure about how to use any text editor and want to learn vim, keep reading this tutorial. If you prefer to start off with a more simple, user friendly text editor, [do this nano tutorial first.](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/)


OK, lets get started....


**AWS and EC2**

AWS (or Amazon Web Services), is a cloud computing platform that offers more than just virtual machine hosting, today we are only going to touch on EC2 which is AWS's main service they provide - virtual machine hosting.

The free tier gives you more than enough to host a Linux server, however the biggest limitation is that you only get 750 hours free per month. This means you can only run 1 server for free. If people are interested, I can do another tutorial on [lxc and lxd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC) which is akin to virtual instances we run in our Virtual Linux server, essentially extending the amount of servers we can use.

***Steps***

1. [Sign up for AWS here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start), confirm your identity with the phone call and credit card details.
2. Pat yourself on the back, you have completed the first part!!

**Creating an EC2 Instance: Ubuntu 16.04**

Amazon have made creating EC2 instances super easy. There is no need to go through installers. In the world of cloud computing, this is a waste of time. Instead, you will choose an [AMI - or Amazon Machine Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html).

An AMI is essentially a vanilla template of a server that is ready to go in miliseconds of creating it. Just choose your variables such as RAM, processing power, storage space etc and you are good to go. It's amazing.

***Steps***

1. Log into AWS and navigate to your EC2 Dashboard.
2. Under the *create instance* header, choose the blue button *Launch Instance*
3. On the left hand side, check the box that says *Free Tier Only* (we don't want to spend money!!)
4. Choose *[Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS \(HVM\), SSD Volume Type - ami-965e6bf3](https://i.imgur.com/BO2ZiVK.png)* (*Note: This may have changed, but at the time of writing this, this is the most up to date Ubunutu server available*)
5. Select the instance type: [t2.micro \(Free tier eligible\)](https://i.imgur.com/h4tfeGS.png)
6. Select *Next: Configure Instance Details* 
7. Leave the defaults and choose *Next: Configure Storage*
8. [Set the storage amount.](https://i.imgur.com/GcY5yNm.png) At the time of writing this, you get up to 30GB of SSD or Magnetic storage for free. It's recommend to have a minimum of 8 GB (default) and if you are only going to only run one EC2 instance, you may as well jack it up to 30GB).
9. Click *Next: Add Tags*, click *Next: Configure Security Groups*
10. We need to open some ports for OpenVPN to work properly. [Configure the settings to look like this](https://i.imgur.com/cpuD48V.png). Feel free to name the group anything you like other than *'default'*
11. Choose *Review and Launch*
12. Choose *Launch*
13. You will be prompted to create a *new key pair*. This consists of a public and private key that are used to securely connect to the new Ubuntu server. Download the private key and **keep it somewhere safe**. We need this file everytime we try to connect to the server via ssh.

Congratualtions, you have configured your first EC2 instace with a headless Ubuntu 16.04 server! It will take a little for AWS to configure everything, but it should become live within a minute or two.

You can optionally give it a name in the instance list. [I've named my OpenVPN](https://i.imgur.com/ZYuBe2g.png).

**Connecting to the Ubuntu Server**

Now that we have got the AWS stuff sorted we need to connect to our new server. If you are on Linux, (which, since this is /r/linux4noobs you should be...) you can open up a terminal. If you are on Windows, go grab KiTTY.

**Steps for Linux**

1. I recommend moving the private key file to the ~/.ssh/ directory for safe keeping. To do so open up bash and enter the command.

        mv path/to/the/keyfile.pem ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem 
Note: Just replace keyfile.pem with the filename that was downloaded.*

2. Now you need to find the Public DNS name. You can get that from the list of EC2 instances. Mine is [ec2-52-15-68-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com](https://i.imgur.com/ZYuBe2g.png). Be careful though, this will likely change after your server is rebooted/powered off. I will discuss how to resolve this later with DDNS.

3. Connect via ssh using the .pem file to identify yourself, ubuntu as the username and the public DNS as the server address:

        ssh -i ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem ubuntu@ec2-52-15-68-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

 You will be prompted to add this server to the list of known hosts. Type *yes* and hit *enter*.

 If you are prompted with: WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE! You need to set the permissions to the keyfile.pem file to only be accessible by yourself. To do so, type the below command and try and ssh in again:

         chmod 700 ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem 

**Updates**

Now we are in our server, first thing is first. We need to update it. Very easy, just enter the command:

    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

>**What does this do**
>
>**sudo** Run as super user 
>
>**apt** call the [advanced package tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_\(Debian\)).
>
>**update** tells **apt** to update the list of software that can be installed 
>
> **&&** joins to commands together
>
>**upgrade** tells **apt** to upgrade the OS and any installed software
>
>**-y** automatically accepts any prompts.

You will also likely get a purple screen stating *Configuring grub-pc*, just choose **keep the local version currently installed**

Congratulations we now have an up-to-date Ubuntu server!

**Configuring the Hostname**

By default the hostname for server should be the IP address which is probably in a 172. address range. You don't need to change the hostname, but if you want to go from Noob-to-Nerd it is good to practice. So, lets use vim to edit the hostname file. vim can be a bit intimidating at first, so feel free to use nano if you prefer but I will walk you through every key stroke.

All you need to know for now about vim is there are 2 (main) modes. Command mode and insert mode. Command mode allows you to type text commands that manipulate text (e.g. delete line, copy text, search, etc) while insert mode allows you to insert text.

So in the terminal type:

    sudo vim /etc/hostname
This command opens the hostname file in vim with [super user rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo). You will now see the hostname of the server. Mine is *ip-172-31-17-240*. We want to remove this and add out own host name so we need to delete the current text with a command. To do this is easy, by default you are in command mode. To enter a command you simply just type. Now enter the command:

    dd
'dd' means delete line. After entering this command, the file should now be empty, ready for us to input text. To enter INSERT mode, enter the command:

    i
Now you can type in the host name you want to name your Ubuntu Server. You can call it anything you like. I am naming mine *OpenVPN*

Once you enter your hostname it should [look like this](https://i.imgur.com/dk6bF9F.png).

To exit insert mode press the **ESC** key.

To save and exit, type the command:

    :wq!

Hit **ENTER**
>Note: Because of historical reasons, some commands require a colon in front of them. The **w** means write (as in write the file), the **q** means quit vim and the **!** means don't prompt for confirmation.
>
>If you want to learn more about you can type :help vim-modes
> 
>You will also notice that there are a lot more modes than the 2 main ones we use)

You should be returned back to the terminal. To check if you saved the file correctly use the cat command:

    cat /etc/hostname

The cat command will print out the contents of the file.


It is also a good idea to set the [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_\(file\)) to hold its new hostname. To do so we need to open the host file in vim, edit it and save and quit in almost the same way we did above. So type the following:

    sudo vim /etc/hosts
    o
    127.0.0.1 [HOSTNAME]

It should look [similar to this](https://i.imgur.com/kOgvTOC.png). 

Now hit the **ESC** key and type

    :wq!

Hit **ENTER**
>Note: **o** inserts a new line below the cursor, **O** inserts a new line above the cursor

And dont forget to check it worked.

    cat /etc/hosts

**Optional tools, shortcuts and settings**

I like to add a few things to my Linux setups to make it a bit more flexible and homely. You don't have to do these steps, but it can be good for troubleshooting (when not if the time comes and because some linux commands should be accomplishible in less characters in my opinion.).

Since the free tier of AWS only offers [dynamic internet facing IP addresses and not a static IP address](https://support.google.com/fiber/answer/3547208?hl=en) it can be necessary to find out the external IP address sometimes. The easy way for desktops is to open the browser and Google 'what is my ip', but we don't have a browser so we need to do it with a command, this is where **curl** steps in...

**curl** is great. Its job is to simply transfer data to or from a server. It supports everything - SMB, FTP, HTTP, LDAP, POP3...the list goes on. In this case, we want it to connect to the website ifconfig.me and pull back the external IP address for our server.

Try it out with:

    curl ifconfig.me

It will return just an external IP address.
>Note: When you SSH into your server, you can also use ubuntu@[ExternalIPAddress]

There is one problem if you are lazy like me. That curl command is 16 characters just to get an IP address. That's too much typing. Lets make a shortcut command for this - they are called aliases.

There is a hidden file in the home directory called the **.bashrc** file. This file customises your terminal envirnoment. One such customisation is setting an alias. You can take a looooooong complex command and rename it to anything you want.

>A colleague of mine types **hulksmash** to run **sudo init 6** (force restart a computer) thanks to aliases.

Now, we can edit the **.bashrc** file like we did above with the **hostname** and **hosts** file, but as I mentioned, I am lazy and opening vim is too much effort. I don't even want to open the file. Let's just append a line to the end of the **.bashrc** file. We want to append the following line:

    alias xip='curl ifconfig.me'
>**What does this do**
>
>**alias** tells bash that an alias to a command now exists
>
> **xip** The name of the alias (you can call this anything you want. e.g. **hulksmash**)
>
>**curl ifconfig.me** The actual command. (Make sure this is wrapped in single quotes)

We need to ask our server to say something back to us, but then redirect the output to to the **.bashrc** file.

To do so type:

     echo ""alias xip='curl ifconfig.me'"" >> ~/.bashrc
> 
> **What does this do**
> 
> **echo** print a line to the terminal that is between """" (in this instance we are printing the line *alias xip='curl ifconfig.me*
> 
> **>>** send the **echo** to a file
>
> **~/.bashrc** the file we are sending our **echo** to.

Now check it worked:

    cat ~/.bashrc

You should see the new alias in the file. Let's test it:

    xip

....and nothing. Why? Well we have not reloaded the modified **.bashrc** file to be active. Lets do that:

    source ~/.bashrc

We should now get our external IP address!
---

The other thing I like to add in is a speed test tool. But there is another problem; I'm not just lazy, I am also forgetful - and I can't remember the name of the speed test command line app that I use. We should search to see if it is in the database (aka the repository) of software we can install. Type:

    apt search speedtest

We should get the output:

    Sorting... Done
    Full Text Search... Done
    speedtest-cli/xenial 0.3.4-1 all
    Command line interface for testing internet bandwidth using speedtest.net

OK, it's called **speedtest-cli**. Let's install it:

    sudo apt install speedtest-cli -y

To use it is really simple. Just type:

    speedtest

The output will look like:

    Retrieving speedtest.net configuration...
    Retrieving speedtest.net server list...
    Testing from Amazon.com (18.188.174.183)...
    Selecting best server based on latency...

    Testing download speed........................................
    Download: 177.71 Mbit/s
    Testing upload speed..................................................
    Upload: 100.99 Mbit/s

Not bad. I got 477Mbit/s down eariler, but beggards can't be choosers.

Anyway, lets continue with actually getting our OpenVPN server working. We are so close I can taste it!


**Installing OpenVPN Server**

Now it's time for the fun stuff. Lets download and configure **OpenVPN** server. 

Firstly we are going to use a tool called **wget**, which just stands for *web get* (i.e, download something from the web). The package we are downloading will be the script that sets up **OpenVPN** (There is a manual way of downloading and installing **OpenVPN**, but this is the easiest way. I can go into detail about the manual setup if people are interested.) We also want to put the scripts in a new directory. You can put it anywhere, but I like to keep everything organised under the /srv directory. So enter the commands:

    sudo mkdir /srv/scripts/
    cd /srv/scripts
    sudo wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh

**What does this do**
>**sudo** run command with super user rights
>
>**mkdir** Make a directory (the path to our directory is /srv/scripts)
>
>**wget** Web Get. Download a file from the internet
>
>**-O** Save the downloaded file as a new filename (in our case the file name is openvpn-install.sh).
 
Now lets grab our external IP address. You will need to remember this during the installation of **OpenVPN**. 

If you did the optional steps above, just enter:

    xip

If you skipped the optional steps enter:

    curl ifconfig.me

Let's run the setup script:

    sudo ./openvpn-install.sh

Damn! That didn't work. But why? Well as far as our server is concerned, this script is just a text file. You can't execute a text file. You need to tell the server that you can, infact execute this file. To do this, we will use **chmod** with the **-x** switch. **chmod** changes permissions of files and directories, whilst the **-x** switch tells chmod to make a file exicutable. So enter the command:

    sudo chmod +x openvpn-install.sh

OK, now we can try and run the script again. But I am still feeling lazy, so instead of typing out all command again, we can all our history of commands and run the command again with far less characters typed. Just enter:

    !-2
>**What does this do**
>
>**!** means run a previous command (you can use **!!** to run the last command again and insert more commands to it. If you forget to add **sudo** to the start of a long command, just run **sudo !!** and it will **sudo** the last command you executed).
>
>**-2** means run the second last command. **-5** would ran the 5th last command.

You should be now greeted with:
    
    Welcome to this quick OpenVPN ""road warrior"" installer
    
    I need to ask you a few questions before starting the setup
    You can leave the default options and just press enter if you are ok with them
    
    First I need to know the IPv4 address of the network interface you want OpenVPN
    listening to.
    IP address: 172.31.17.240

Keep the default IP address and hit **ENTER**

You will be asked if you want  **UDP** or **TCP** connections. [This article](https://support.holmsecurity.com/hc/en-us/articles/212963869-What-is-the-difference-between-TPC-and-UDP-) explains the different transmission types. We will stick with UDP, so enter **1** and hit **ENTER**


Now you will prompted to choose a port that OpenVPN will operate on. Remember back in the **Creating an EC2 Instance: Ubuntu 16.04**, [we opened up some ports](https://i.imgur.com/cpuD48V.png) for our server to talk on? Well OpenVPN talks on 1194. You can think of ports as lanes on a freeway that only one type of traffic can go at a time: the fast lane, slow lane, commuter lane, bus lane. But instead of cars we have programs. OpenVPN only can go down lane (or port) 1194, SSH can only go down lane 22 etc. We can tell these programs they can go down other ports, but we don't have too. Keep it the default of 1194 if that is the port that was opened before, or set it to your custom port.

>**Note:** Why do we change ports if we dont have to? Well, sometimes people scan to find open ports that they can attack. Because there are so many ports, these people usually only scan for the default ones. If we change our port from the default to something obscure like changing **OpenVPN** to talk on port 1989 it is less likely someone will find it. This is called *security through obscurity*.

You will be asked what you want to set your [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) to. Google DNS works fine, [OpenDNS has some extra functionality](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/) like malware filtering and other bits and peices. I am going to stick with Google.

Now you will be asked about the client certificate. This is a file that authenticates the person connecting to the VPN. You can name this what you like and you can have more than just one. 
>If you do want more than one, re-run the script and you will only be asked for the name for the client certificate. 

I am just going to stick with the default *client*

Now press *any key*. 

The script will now go and download **OpenVPN** as well as **easy-rsa** with **apt**, then configure OpenVPN and generate an [RSA key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\(cryptosystem\)) with **easy-rsa**.

Now, remember how we asked about the external IP address? We need to enter it now. If you forgot it, or didn't write it down. You can get it from the instance list in the AWS control panel.

Technically, that's it. You have a fully functional VPN server, but it is of no use yet. You need to copy the client configuration file. By default it will be found in:

    ~/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn

In my case, my file is found in:

    ~/client.ovpn

We will need to use a function [secure copy shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy) (**scp**) to get this down to our local machine. **scp** is based on **ssh** and is very easy to use.

If your local machine is running linux, we will make a new hidden folder called **.openvpn** in our home directory (**~**)

First open a new terminal, one that is for your local machine.

Enter the following command to make a new hidden directory:

    mkdir ~/.openvpn
>**Note:** a **.** before a directory name makes it hidden

Now let's copy down the client configuration file from our server.

Still in the terminal for our local machine, enter the command:

    scp -i ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem ubuntu@[YOURSERVERSPUBLICIPADDRESS]:/home/ubuntu/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn ~/.openvpn/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn
>Remember that ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem is where you placed the key to access your AWS Ubuntu server on your local computer.

>**What does this do**
>**scp** secure copy files from a remote server
>
>**-i** tells scp to use the key file to authenicate the connection to the server
>
>**ubuntu** The username to use.
>
>**@[YOURSERVERSPUBLICIPADDRESS]** The internet facing IP address of our server
>
>**:/home/ubuntu/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn** where our file is found on the remote server
>
>**~/.openvpn/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn** Where we are saving our file to.

The output should like something like:

    client.ovpn                         100% 8219     8.0KB/s   00:00

Congratulations! You should now have the OpenVPN client configuration file. Remember where this file is, we will use it later when setting up the OpenVPN client.

**Dynamic DNS with NoIP**

One issue with AWS is that on the free tier you only get a dynamic IP address. Meaning you only get to borrow and internet address for the time your server is on for. Each time you reboot your server, you will get a new IP address, so after each reboot every time you want to connect to your VPN client you will need to log on to the AWS dashboard, look at the instances, get the IP address, update the client.ovpn file and then connect. In my book, that is waaay to much work. With Dynamic DNS we can tell it to look at an address that automatically gets translated into an IP address.

**Example:**

> **Without Dynamic DNS**
> 
> My server is on 192.168.0.1 (Yes, this is a private IP address, but it's easy for arguement sake to use this address).
> 
> My client.ovpn file is set to point to 192.168.0.1
> 
> I reboot my server. Its IP is now 192.168.0.55
> 
> I try to connect to my VPN but 192.168.0.1 is not there anymore! damn!
> 
> **With Dynamic DNS:**
> 
> My server is on 192.168.0.1
> 
> My client.ovpn file is set to point to myvpnserver.com
> 
> myvpnserver.com currently resolves to 192.168.0.1
> 
> I reboot my server
> 
> The server address is now 192.168.0.55
> 
> A small program from No-IP running on my server updates the Dynamic DNS that the new server IP is 192.168.0.55 and that myvpnserver.com should resolve to this new IP.
> 
> I try and connect to my vpn with myvpnserver.com and BAM! It still works! 

So, let's set this up!

I really like [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/), but there are other providers out there. DynDNS is another company, but they charge now I think. The only draw back with No-IP is they require you to confirm you still want to use your Dynamic DNS every 30 days. Don't worry, they will email you when your time is close to up!

So, go [sign up for a No-IP account](https://www.noip.com/sign-up).

Once signed up, create a host name. To do so:

* Click on *Dynamic DNS* on the left side menu
* Click *Create Hostname*
* Enter the hostname you want. I am going to use *openvpntutorial*, but you can call it anything you want.
* Choose the domain name. I use *ddns.net*, but again you can use anything you want.
* Set the record type to **DNS Host (A)**
* Enter the public ip address of your server under the *IPv4 Address*
* Click *Create Hostname*

So we are still missing the *Dynamic* part of **Dynamic DNS**. To make it auto update with the new IP, we need to install the No-IP client. Go back to the terminal that is connected to your ubnutu server and enter the commands:

    cd /usr/local/src/
    sudo wget http://www.no-ip.com/client/linux/noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
    sudo tar xf noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
    cd noip-2.1.9-1/
    sudo make install

>**What does this do**
>
>**cd** change directory
>
>**wget** web get the no-ip client
>
>**tar** means invoke the tar program which is used to compress and decompress tar files (similar to zip files).
>
> **x** flags **tar** to extract the contents
>
>**f** flag signals to tar that what is following is the filename of the tar file.
> 
>**cd noip-2.1.9-1/** means change directory to the directory that was decompressed by **tar* 
>
>**make install** run **make** and build No-IP with the instructions in the  **install** file.


Damn! It failed! Why? **make** is not installed. We will need to install this through **apt** to get this working. We are also missing a dependancy **gcc**. Let's get these installed. Enter the command:

    sudo apt install make gcc -y

Now rerun our **make** command...do it the lazy way.

    sudo !-2

You will be prompted to choose the interface that talks to the internet with. In our case it is **eth0** so enter **0** and hit **ENTER**

You will then be asked to enter your username/email address and password used for your No-IP account. 

After entering your credentials, you will likely be defaulted to using the dynamic hostname you just created in No-IP. If you have more than one hostname created, you will be prompted to choose.

You will be prompted for an update interval. The default is 30 minutes. I recommend setting it to 5 minutes.

Next you will be prompted to run something at startup. Just hit **ENTER**

If all was successful you should see:

    New configuration file '/tmp/no-ip2.conf' created.
    
    mv /tmp/no-ip2.conf /usr/local/etc/no-ip2.conf

Congratulations! We now have Dynamic DNS setup and working.

**Configuring the DNS Client - Linux**

I am only going to go through the configuraton for Linux since this is /r/linux4noobs . [Windows](https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/docs/admin-guides-sp-859543150/howto-connect-client-configuration/395-how-to-install-the-openvpn-client-on-windows.html), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn&hl=en_GB), [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/openvpn-connect/id590379981?mt=8) and [Mac](https://tunnelblick.net/) are quite a bit more straight forward than the Linux.

First up, we should edit our client ovpn file because at the moment, it is not using our **No-IP Dynamic DNS**

So, open the file in vim:

    vim ~/.openvpn/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn

Find the line  **remote [IPADDRESS] [PORT NUMBER]**

e.g. **remote 13.59.65.209 1194**

Put your cursor over the line and remove it then add a new blank line with:

    dd
    O

Now enter **INSERT** mode with:

    i

Type in the following:

    remote [YOUR DYNAMIC DNS HOSTNAME] [PORT NUMBER]

As an example, mine was:

    remote openvpntutorial.ddns.net 1194

Save the file with the following commands:

**ESC**
    :wq!
**ENTER**

Check it saved right:

    cat ~/.openvpn/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn


Now we call **apt** to install the OpenVPN client:

    sudo apt install openvpn

It should have the changes we made to the remote server with our **Dynamic DNS** name and the **OpenVPN** port number

Next we need to open our VPN connection with the client ovpn file that we used **scp** to copy down to our computer earlier. Make sure to always **sudo** this command, otherwise it won't connect. Enter the command:

    sudo openvpn --config ~/.openvpn/[YOURCLIENTNAME].ovpn

In my case it was:

    sudo openvpn --config ~/.openvpn/client.ovpn

If all went well, after a bunch of output lines of text the last one you should get is:

    Initialization Sequence Completed

And thats it. We are on our VPN.

To confirm check your external IP on your server and on your local machine. If they match, you are golden!!

**Optional for the Lazy**

The last thing I would add to this, to make life a little easier again is to set an alias in your **.bashrc** file to more easily connect to the vpn. You can find the steps above and don't forget to reload your bash config once you set the alias!.

Also you can make your ssh connection a lot easier. Open up the ssh config file in vim:

    vim  ~/.ssh/config

Enter the following settings at the bottom of the file.

    Host openvpn
          Hostname [YOUR DYNAMIC DNS HOSTNAME]
          User ubuntu
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/keyfile.pem

Save the file and now you can connect with:

    ssh openvpn

**Troubleshooting**

One thing I have come across is sometimes (and aparently only on Ubuntu) the VPN config fails to work and you need to add the following lines at the bottom of the ovpn file:

    up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
    down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf


**Quick Edit:**

I'm back from the cabin in the woods and will be answering questions/discussion points as well as fixing up the tutorial shortly! But wanted to point out what /u/NickUnrelatedToPost mentioned in a comment. Thank you for that Nick!

linux4noobs,"How many of you out there are the only person in your circle of friends who cares about any of this at all? Even the tech savvy crowd?

I feel like the more I learn in Linux the more distant I feel from everyone around me. We're starting to speak in different languages.

While you folks are wonderfully supportive, It's difficult to get excited about something and having nobody to talk shop with in person about the bullshit thing of the day that we learned in Linux or projects that we want to do.

How do you get passed the loneliness that appears to come with this territory?"
linux4noobs,"I realize this is not a strictly Linux thing, but as we all know, people lose critical and irreplaceable data all the time.  Sometimes we are able to help them recover that data, but an ounce of prevention and all that.

**What should you back up?**

You should have backups of any data that A) is useful to you and B) can't be reliably replaced (rescanned, re-downloaded, or get a copy from uncle JimmyJoBob).

**What if I don't back up?**

Statistically speaking, you *will* eventually lose something that can't be replaced.  Family photos, your thesis, the notes from that meeting, the song you recorded with your dad.  It's just a matter of when, what, and how much you lose due to a drive failure, fire, flood, or theft.

**How do I back up?**

The first rule is 3-2-1.  Tried and true.  You should have at least 3 copies of your data, on 2 different media, at least 1 of which is stored offsite from your computer.

**Three copies.**  That's pretty easy.  You want three copies of the file.

**Two different media.**  That's a little more complicated.  Having two copies of the data on the same hard drive (same media) is NOT a backup.  If the single drive fails, you've lost both copies.  Likewise, having two copies in the same email account (same media) is NOT a backup.  If that email service craps out, you've lost both copies.

The idea is that you don't want a single failure to wipe out both copies.  Another example of ""not a backup"" is RAID.  RAID arrays are ""fault tolerant"" in that they can survive some drive problems / failures, but fault tolerance is NOT considered having an additional copy of the data and doesn't count as a backup.

So for ""different media"" we really mean that if your original is on your hard drive, then your backups should NOT be on that hard drive.  They should be on a cloud storage, removable media, NAS, etc that is not a permanent part of your computer.

**At least ONE offsite.**  This one is key.  If you have 500 copies of your critical files, stored on 500 different media, but they are all at your home/office... well what if the house burns down or floods?  What if someone steals it all?  These things can happen.  So at least ONE of those copies should be offsite.  This could include remote cloud storage, a remote server, or even a hard drive that you store somewhere far from your computer (home, office, or bank lock box, etc).

So let's make this easy.  Assuming your critical photos / documents / etc, are on your computer's hard drive, what's a decent strategy?

Copy 1:  Local HDD.  Duh.

Copy 2:  Remote storage.  For this, I recommend using a FOSS option like Nextcloud, duplicity, rdiff-backup, borgbackup, rsync coupled with a remote server you own / have access to, or a proprietary program such as Crashplan, SpiderOak, Carbonite.  I believe that these can all be configured to do incremental backups at set times, near-real-time backups, and versioning. [Thanks to /u/overtmind for FOSS examples]

Another key point here:  A real-time sync is NOT a remote backup **if** it doesn't have versioning.  That is, if deleting the local file also deletes the remote file in real-time, and there is not way to get an older archived version of the file, **that is not a backup**.  

Copy 3:  For this, since we've already satsified the off-site aspect, we can just do a second copy on a local NAS, removable media (HDD/DVD/USB).  This allows fast recovery if something as mundane as a local file corruption or primary HDD crash happens.

Okay, NOW you have backups.  You know what else is not a backup?  One that hasn't been tested.  If you haven't tested your ability to recover data from a backup, **you have no verified backup**.

How do you test this?  Easy enough.  Back up some trivial data you don't care about to all three locations from time to time.  Then delete it from your primary drive.

Now, and this is critical, **wait a reasonable amount of time**.  Think about how long it might be before you realize that a file you needed has been corrupted or is missing.  A few hours?  A few days?  You want your test to mimic that scenario as much as reasonably possible.

Now try to recover a copy from **each** of your backups.  If you can do so, you are golden. If not, then one or more of your backup locations is not reliable and should be replaced or fixed.

I hope folks found this useful.  There's nothing more heartbreaking than hearing a friend or relative tell you how they lost years of photos, scanned documents, or other irreplaceable 0s and 1s.  Don't let it happen to you.  "
linux4noobs,"Posting this just to express how unexpectedly pleased I'm feeling at not having to resort to my usual trick of booting from a USB stick or another distro on a different partition to look up the solution on the internet and use the tools in *that* distro to fix it.


It's probably of no interest to anyone else, but I'm going to post this here anyway.


Today I installed a new distro onto a spare partition on my SSD, resizing the partition in the process (I'd originally made the partitions unnecessarily large).


That went fine, it all worked great.


But then I rebooted and selected my normal distro from grub... and failure.


Not the end of the world, I'd backed up my drives immediately before installing the new distro (which always seems the sensible thing to do), plus I had the new distro and a bootable Puppy-Linux USB and my phone as lifelines with which to seek a solution.


But for the time-being I decided to pretend I didn't have all that to fall back on. So, how do I fix this?


To cut a long story short (and leaving out a lot of useless stumbling around with only the vaguest idea of what I was doing) it occurred to me that something similar had happened to me before when I'd replaced my HDD with a bigger one, and the system failed to boot properly because it was trying to mount a drive that wasn't there.


Could changing the partition have had the same effect?


I remembered that I'd had to edit fstab to get the new drive mounted in place of the last one. So *where* was fstab?


After a bit of looking around I eventually found it.


I decided I didn't want to mess things up *too* badly in case this didn't work, so:


    mv fstab.old fstab.older
    cp fstab fstab.old


But how to edit it? I don't know how to use vi or emacs. Wait! I vaguely remembered that one of the pages I'd looked up when I first edited fstab had suggested using nano. Worth a try:


    nano fstab


It worked!


After a brief experience of ""Oh crap, I deleted the wrong line. How do I exit without saving?"" I managed to comment-out the line for mounting that partition then save-and-exit.


Next step:


    reboot


When I'd tried that before trying to edit fstab I just ended up with it doing a file system check before exiting into emergency mode again.


This time however, it worked!


Problem solved all on my own without looking up the answers or falling back on booting from a different distro to use the tools in that distro to fix it.


I feel so proud of myself. Like a five year-old feeling proud of themselves for managing to color-in the picture without going outside the lines.


It might not be impressive to anyone else, but it's a personal milestone that I've managed to pass.

linux4noobs,"Hey guys, Firefox just released and update due to a zero day vulnerability.

For Ubuntu/Debian:

Check tour current version of Firefox.

On your terminal do the following

sudo apt-get update

Then sudo apt-get upgrade -y

The -y just won’t ask you if you are sure to upgrade. And that command will actually upgrade all your apps that have updates at once, not just Firefox.

Open Firefox and check your version."

linux4noobs,"Recently my girlfriend's friend needed to do a lot of typing work instead of just using her tablet. My girlfriend decided to help by having her use her very old laptop. But the version of Windows was way out of support and it ran like a dog even when she stopped using it years ago. 

I had spoken about Linux enough that she asked me about it the other day and I suggested a couple of distros and explained how to make a bootable USB from the iso.

My girlfriend just sent me this message: 
`I got Lubuntu running on my old laptop, turns out it could boot from USB after all. [My friend] said: why would anyone use Windows? 😁`

Feels good. :-)"
linux4noobs,"I have no idea what I've gotten myself into. Any help is appreciated.

Seriously though, all this information is great. I was able to get steam up and running today, along with a lot of recommended applications and such. I was trying to get AMD's drivers for my video card(Radeon HD 6790) but apparently there's a library issue with 14.04.2 or something so I guess that's out of the question. I've got a lot of reading to do today but I think I've got a hang for the very bare minimum basics of what I have to do to not completely destroy my OS so far. "
linux4noobs,"So I've been a Windows user my whole life and have very minimal experience with Linux. I've dabbled a bit, but I'm not quite tech savvy enough to really do anything super in depth, like editing operating system files and the like. 

I hear people talking all the time about how Linux gives you so much more freedom to customize your system and what not, but I rarely hear any specific details about what they do, what projects they have done, etc. So my question is what exactly do you do with Linux on a regular basis that you can't do/isn't convenient to do on Windows/OSX? Or at least what are some such projects or tasks you have recently done? "
pcgamingtechsupport," How  do I check if Riot's Vanguard client is completely uninstalled? Not  wanting to play the game enough to risk something like this... it gets kernel level privileges and runs all the time. Battle eye and other AC only run when the game is running. The service is stopped otherwise.

During  installation it said it was installing it and before valorant finished  installing I stopped it. I then went to add remove programs and clicked uninstall for Valorant and the separate anti cheat program, Vanguard. Is there a way to check if the  process is running?

Here is a description of the program that gets installed when you first install Valorant:

[https://www.techspot.com/news/84841-valorant-anti-cheat-software-loads-kernel-based-driver.html](https://www.techspot.com/news/84841-valorant-anti-cheat-software-loads-kernel-based-driver.html)"
pcgamingtechsupport,"**Update (20 July):** *I have learned of an alternate solution to fix this problem, which does not require having to download anything and does not appear to cause problems with any other games (e.g. BioShock). As of now I believe this should be the preferred solution. See ""Option #1"" below for the update.*

&nbsp;

**tl;dr:** The ""Games Explorer"" hub in Windows 7 and Vista is preventing older PC games from launching. Check the list of symptoms below. You can fix it by making a single change in your Windows registry - see Option #1.

&nbsp;

In the last few weeks, Microsoft shut down servers related to the [Games Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_for_Windows#Games_Explorer) feature in Windows 7 and Vista (possibly related to the end-of-life [announcement](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/farewell-to-microsoft-internet-games-on-windows-xp/035d5144-6c1b-49bb-b3d5-37f6355fec39) for the integrated Internet Games service). As a result, there are a *ton* of older PC games that will not run anymore on those operating systems.

When you launch one of these games, the **gameux.dll** file in Windows' System32 or SysWOW64 directory tries to contact Microsoft's servers in order to update the game's profile in Games Explorer. The game will not start until the profile update is complete. Since the relevant servers are offline now, the update will never happen.

This problem affects hundreds of popular games. In my testing I have found titles that were released from 1998 through 2006.

&nbsp;

The symptoms of this problem are:

- The game window does not appear after launching it, but the game's executable does not crash and there is no error message. 

  (*If you ARE getting an error message, then you have an unrelated problem and these solutions will not fix it.*)

- When you launch the game, a **rundll32.exe** process is started and visible in Task Manager, which is using about 8 MB of RAM and also appears to be frozen.
- If you add the Command Line column to Task Manager, you can see that the target of rundll32.exe is *C:\Windows\System32\gameux.dll* or *C:\Windows\SysWOW64\gameux.dll*

&nbsp;

There are two ways to fix this:

&nbsp;

**Option #1 (recommended)**

The best solution I know of is to modify the Windows registry so that Games Explorer points to a [loopback address](https://www.lifewire.com/network-computer-special-ip-address-818385) - meaning your own computer - instead of Microsoft's servers. I found this solution on GOG's troubleshooting [page](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025926714), who grabbed it from a user in their [forums](https://www.gog.com/forum/general/old_games_not_launching_and_eating_100_of_the_cpu_on_windows_7/page1).

Here are the steps to take:

- Open the Registry Editor. You can find it by searching for ""Registry Editor"" (without quotes) in the Start Menu.
- In the left side of the Registry Editor, navigate to the following folder:

    *Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\GameUX\ServiceLocation*

- Create a backup by right-clicking the *ServiceLocation* folder and selecting *Export*.

    Give it a name like ""Games Explorer backup"" (without quotes) and save it somewhere on your hard drive, in case you need to undo the changes.

- Now in the right side of the Registry Editor, right-click *Games* and select *Modify*.
- In the *Value Data* box, delete the current entry and replace it with *127.0.0.1*
- Then click *OK* and close the Registry Editor.
- You may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

&nbsp;

**Option #2**

If Option #1 doesn't work or you'd rather not modify the Windows registry, you can simply disable both of the gameux.dll files instead.

The gameux.dll files are only used for Games Explorer, so disabling them is completely safe. Someone created a batch file in 2012 that will do this easily, and it is reversible by running the file again.

There is at least one game - the original version of BioShock - that won't run if gameux.dll is disabled, so re-enabling the files may be necessary.

I did not find any other other games with this requirement after spending a few hours testing and searching the internet, but if you happen to come across any, please leave a comment to let me know (launching the game should give you an error message that says ""*Failed to create the GameExplorer object*"" or something similar).

[This is the blog post](http://ubeogesh-things.blogspot.com/2012/08/resolve-it-finally-game-explorer-aka.html) that has the needed file (download link is about 2/3 of the way down).

[Mirror](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OW4ogjIBOVQsVAA9F5piZLjkyY34pqte) (Google Drive)

- Extract **GameUxFixed-Ubeogesh.bat** from the archive to a temporary folder.
- Run it, then press any key to apply the patch. If you get an error message about not having ownership privileges, run it again by right-clicking and selecting ""*Run as administrator.*""
- You might need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
- Run the .bat file again to undo the changes, if necessary.

&nbsp;

I originally learned about this problem through [this thread](https://www.gog.com/forum/general/games\_explorer\_gameuxdll\_and\_rundll32\_issues\_with\_offline\_gaming) on GOG, which also points to a number of other sources with more details. [This post](https://superuser.com/questions/1075848/why-does-windows-games-explorer-attempt-to-access-the-internet-whenever-i-laun) on superuser.com was particularly helpful for me, and I also learned that this has been an issue with Windows since at least [April 2010](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-gaming/windows-7-game-explorer-interfering-with-game/efd39c74-cfab-4c2c-b6c5-834b8849a1b3).

I haven’t been able to test myself, but my brother has done the following without success


- Changed only RAM module to a different slot 
- changed GPU to different slot
- plugged and unplugged PSU cables into GPU
- tried to get video from all HDMI ports, 2 from GPU, 1 from MB

Everything is stock, didn’t try overclocking and when it failed it was just downloading a steam game at a throttled 8Mbps. Nothing running in the background or anything. 

It’s just like when I hadn’t updated the bios, same thing. No video, no tones, nothing.

all the LEDs working like they always did when it was ok.

Any clues on what to do next would be appreciated.

EDIT: booted with GPU completely off, no change. 

Checked RAM on a different computer and doesn’t work. Does that mean its either CPU or MB problem?

Checked that all connections were tight, pushed in ram all the way in and reset the MB by removing the coin cell battery, and it all worked"
pcgamingtechsupport,"### Help, please..

&nbsp;

**Preambel**

&nbsp;

Dear reddit - I'm really frustrated since the powerhouse that I built myself still isn't working properly. Let me preface the current situation by mentioning me having a lot of bad luck (had a CPU that was dead on arrival, a faulty Motherboard etc.) and ongoing problems with my PC, therefore naming him ""Beast"" since he seems to be unruly as fuck.

I built this rig back in march and after sorting out all the faulty hardware I, for whatever reason, got when buying all my shit the rig ran fine for a few weeks, but then blue screens started to appear. Not one, but many. The PC crashes every time whether before the Windows Startup screen or right when I entered my password and it's checking if it's valid. It then stopped for a few weeks, and re-appeared. This kept going on over the year but I was always like ""give 'em a bit of time, don't be too pushy"" and lo behold - at some point he ran fine.

Only to now start messing with me again.. but I'm fed up, really. I since started studying VFX / 3D Animation and need this workstation working properly whenever I need it to. So please, if you could help me that'd be wonderful.

I googled the shit out of all those error messages but all I get is ""deinstall third party software"".. thing is; the problem existed before installing anything other than Windows, too. I also reinstalled Windows a couple of times. Still the same.

&nbsp;

**Issue**

&nbsp;

Keeps crashing and having blue screens with different error codes. The rig starts in safe mode, though. This problem is not reproducable since the rig kind of decides when to mess up itself.

&nbsp;

**Error-Codes:**

&nbsp;

IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL 
&nbsp;

PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA
&nbsp;

 KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED 
&nbsp;

SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION 
&nbsp;

KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE

&nbsp;

**Attempts to Fix the Problem**

&nbsp;

1. I re-installed Windows multiple times - the problem still occurred.
2. I tried to pin down every bit of bloat-ware that could've come with the hardware pre-installed (looking at you ASUS and their fucking Nahimic Service)
3. Stress-tested CPU and RAM. Both work fine.
4. I checked every cable and pin multiple times on their correct position.

pcgamingtechsupport,"I think I may have finally gone off the deep end with these 2080ti cards and EVGA.      

I'm going to try to keep this short, but please forgive me if I write too much.     



I get a 2080ti 6/7 months ago. 1 dead fan. RMA it.      

2nd card works great for 6/7 months.      

Both of these cards came in brand new, retail packaging.      

2nd card had a random 'flicker' that was different than a standard black screen, it was a broken up image.      

\-Existed since the beginning but was getting worse.     

RMA 2nd card about a month ago.     

\-Queue insanity origins-       

3rd card arrives and lasts 8 days. Artifacts.      

4th card arrives and lasts 14 days. Artifacts.       

Multiple support threads all over. Mixed opinions, GPU and others PSU.     

Replace my PSU and install 5th card. Lasts 1-2 days then starts crashing. Event ID 13.       

Investigate and find nearly 20,000 Event ID 13 logs from exact date of 3rd card arrival.    

100-200 of these logs would generate every time the game artifacted/froze and needed reboot.      

The other two actually artifacted but this one did not and still has not.      

I make an acronis back up image, reset all CPU/memory O/C (stable for 1.5+ years) get a brand new O/S installed, get all updates and DDU nvidia drivers on a fresh O/S to be extremely safe, especially concerning Windows Update and blocked internet upon reboot.       

As soon as nvidia drivers installed, black screen. Reboot. Red screen of death after Windows login screen.     

Windows 10 Red Screen of Death. That's new.... google results in, 'check oc' 'bad gpu' 'bad factory oc' etc etc.     

Underclock core/memory by a few hundred and oh wow, everything is back to normal. Maybe EVGA did bad OC, no wories, I'll just go fully insane and keep this card underclocked.       

Maybe 20-30 minutes of Division 2 and same issues again.      



Frustrated, restore Acronis image and game on HD 630, onboard GPU built into 7700k CPU.       

Hours and hours go by. Run a Heaven benchmark for 5 hours, all good.     

Put in a GTX 1050 that was used previously around 3rd/4th card as a backup GPU. Again, Division 2 and Heaven pass several hour points with ZERO issues.      

Lose my shit at 'nuclear option' version 2 suggestion. They suggest to re-do all O/S and factory oc, etc etc.      

Also suggest that my UPS, battery backup that's been running for over a year, may be an issue.       

Buy a brand new RX 580 from Amazon PrimeNow. Play Division 2 for 3 hours. Follow up with a 6 hour long benchmark in Heaven. Everything is still going strong.      



So I don't understand how 3 different GPU can work in the same exact hardware, setup, cables, everything... but still somehow... my computer is the issue. Oh no.. my O/S is the issue.. Oh no.. my PSU is the issue.. Oh no.. my UPS battery back up is the issue..      



I would be more inclined to believe them if this was a new/recent 2080ti purchase but no... the 2nd replacement they sent me worked for 6/7 months. It was RMAd for a stupid rare flicker. THEY DIDNT EVEN FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT! I've actually requested it back as at this point, flickering is much better than this nightmare.      



My question is, have I missed something crucial? How the fuck could 3 different GPU work with the same exact setup? How could this seriously be anything other than EVGA cucking me around with 3 refurbished units instead of a brand new one for a $1250 product I purchased new? Am I just fucking insane?"

pcgamingtechsupport,"I sold my delidded i7-7700K online, and wrote five pages (1700 words) worth of instructions to the person who purchased it, with several links to guides and video tutorials that he could follow.

For practical reasons, I never resealed the processor, and shipped it along with the remaining Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut that I'd used. I specifically told the buyer that if it weren't enough to cover the die and the inside of the IHS (a third-party 100% copper one that I also included in his order), he'd have to buy additional liquid metal, for proper coverage.

Apparently, my warnings didn’t suffice, as he claimed that there was insufficient liquid metal, and not only YOLO'd it on the die alone, but also ran a bunch of games without even checking the temperatures of the cores using HWiNFO64, as I had suggested (a 3-5C difference between cores if fine - 8-10C or more is not fine). ~~Now, he's telling me that only 2c/4t are showing up in Task Manager and CPU-Z.~~

~~Did he fry the remaining cores/threads? The processor shows up correctly in his BIOS (Asus Prime B250M mobo - which revision is a mystery to me), and I already ran him through the msconfig settings (""Normal startup"" and unchecked ""Number of processors"" under Boot Advanced Options).~~

~~What else is there to do? He said his BIOS is updated to the latest version, and he also reset it to its factory settings.~~

**UPDATE:** He followed my msconfig/BIOS instructions once more (correctly, this time) and all 4c/8t are now showing up. However, his idle temps are concerning me. [This is what they look like](https://i.ibb.co/HV6ppHs/temps.png).

I feel like he should take the processor out and apply the liquid metal again (on both the die *and* the IHS, as I made perfectly clear from the beginning), but I'm afraid he may screw up things even more, somehow. What do you all think? He only cares about gaming.

**UPDATE #2:** Thanks for the answers, everyone. I did my best in instructing him prior to the sale, going as far as saying that he didn't seem to be the ideal candidate for handling a delidded CPU, and should stick to factory sealed ones, instead. He still went ahead with the purchase.

Now, after helping the buyer fix the lacking cores/threads issue, I said that whatever happens to his processor is out of my control. I did my part in selling a fully functional product, and thoroughly emphasized all the risks involved, not to mention the correct procedures. It's up to him to follow them and take good care of his CPU.

**UPDATE #3:** To clarify even further, I did let him know that, while still within Intel's ""safe"" standards, his temps were a bit too high (especially after he shared an actual [HWiNFO 64 screenshot of the CPU load during a gaming session](https://i.ibb.co/CsYjXD9/temps.jpg)), and my personal recommendation was to buy some more Conductonaut and apply the liquid metal again, making sure to follow all of my instructions the second time.

He agreed and was very understanding, thanking me and saying that he'd positively qualify the sale. All in all, a very pleasant experience (even if it started by almost giving me a panic attack)."

pcgamingtechsupport," So on black friday I ordered myself a razerblade stealth since they were on sale. I noticed that it still hasn't shipped even though it's been over a week, so I started a live chat with Razer's support team and they asked me to send them my employer's name and address, and also my business phone number. Obviously, I'm not very comfortable with sharing all of that information to buy a damn laptop. Has anyone else had to go through this? Why do they need all of this info? I didn't even receive an email telling me that my order had been canceled so honestly, I'm a little pissed.

Edit: they've even asked to have a ""conference call"" with me and my bank in order to prove my identity. This is my first time buying from razer and honestly will probably be my last."

pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi everyone

I have discovered a simple way to copy games downloaded using the new Xbox (Beta) app from one PC to another. I often need to do this as I have terribly slow, capped home internet. I hope this can help anyone else in this situation.

**This guide is specifically for Win32 games packaged as Windows Store apps.** Think games like Tomb Raider and Wolfenstein, but not special ""Windows 10"" versions like Superhot: Windows 10 or State of Decay 2. For those UWP games, if you can't find them in the MSIXVC folder, please see my other guide linked below.

You will want to start by downloading the game of choice on PC 1. The game will be downloaded into `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\MSIXVC` on your OS drive, or `Z:\WindowsApps\MSIXVC` on any other drive. Once downloaded, you will need administrator privileges to gain access to this folder, the easiest way is to double click > Continue > click the security tab link, then change owner to yourself, close the security window, double click again, Continue. You will have to do this for both the WindowsApps and MSIXVC folders.

Before copying anything to PC 2, start by downloading a couple megabytes of the game on the target PC, just enough so the Xbox app creates the target folder and files on PC 2. You will want to repeat the same process above of taking ownership of the WindowsApps and MSIXVC folders.

You will notice the apps are represented as groups of three files, each starting with a long ID string. The files are <ID> with no extension, which is the main game file, <ID>.xvi (unknown), and <ID>.xvs, which contains some metadata about the game. You can open this <ID>.xvs file in Notepad or Notepad++ to check which game ID you want to copy over (it's just a JSON file so pasting it in an online JSON formatter can make it easier to read). The game ID will be the same between PC 1 and PC 2.

Now, you're almost ready to copy. However, make sure to close the Xbox app (and kill it from Task Manager for good measure) on the target PC to ensure it doesn't have a lock on the files, otherwise you won't be able to overwrite them. Now, you should be able to copy all 3 files with the given ID from PC 1 to PC 2 using your preferred method (direct Ethernet cable is probably fastest).

Then, simply open up the Xbox app again, and resume the download. It should immediately jump up to Downloading 100%, then install the game for you.

I was worried this would be a complex process like it is for Windows store apps (see my post here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/bywnqr/why\_is\_the\_microsoft\_store\_so\_anticonsumer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/bywnqr/why_is_the_microsoft_store_so_anticonsumer/)), but it's almost as straightforward as copying Steam games. Hopefully Microsoft adds an official way to do this as the app gets closer to a 1.0 release."
pcgamingtechsupport,"I built my first pc two months ago, and it ran great for the first week. I could definitely notice the difference between 240 frames vs console frames. However, since then my pc’s performance has deteriorated greatly. My FPS counter remains as advertised, but I know that I’m not actually getting 240 frames; it feels more like 60-80 fps. I’ve ran 3D mark tests, hw info tests, cpu-z, gpu z, and ran memtest 64 all night long with no errors or issues. I reinstalled windows and removed all drivers with ddu. When I took these last steps my pc briefly returned to its original performance for about 45 mins, and then started performing poorly again. All the numbers on those tests I mentioned were good or great. My monitor is brand new as well.  I also tried switching surge protectors, and this also improved my performance for about 45 mins.  It's just bizarre how my pc responds to things.  For example, whenever I download a certain software or use a software I haven't used in a while my performance will improve for a few minutes.  I've also replaced my motherboard and borrowed RAM sticks from a friend.  When I first installed the motherboard it seemed like everything was back to normal, but again this only lasted for a day or so.  When I used a friends RAM my pc ran much better for about half a day.  It seems like every time something new is introduced to the pc, whether it is software or hardware, the performance will improve depending on how important whatever I added was.  I also setup in a different room, and again my performance improved for about 30 minutes.  Other weird things that improve performance temporarily include opening monitoring software like MSI afterburner.  I know it’s unlikely, but could the electricity from my outlet be causing this issue?  I don’t want to drag my rig to someone else’s place unless this is actually a plausible cause. Sorry for the long read.  My cpu clocks never fluctuate from 4100 mhz, and my gpu clocks only ever drop down from 2005 mhz to 1995 mhz.

Edit: I ran malwarebytes as well on the off chance that I somehow had a virus, but it didn't detect anything. Just a little baffled at this point, and want to inquire about this before I haul it off to my microcenter.

Edit:  I forgot to mention that when I unplug my computer completley for a day or so it will perform well for the first half hour that I'm playing.  When I don't unplug it overnight, the performance is awful from the rip.

Recently, i've been asked about a way to reward the users that are investing time in the sub. That was something i've already had a thought about but never had much time to do, between moderating, answering and other stuff i do with my life (i work sometimes, i promise).

A user flair has been created to identify the ""regulars"" around here. For now, i have to add them manually. I even have to identify them manually which makes the whole process very time consuming. The idea behind that would be that user that come here for the first time, or that are stressed because they f\*cked up or whatever, would recognized quickly who is knowledgeable and who is less knowledgeable. Those users might also have access to editing the wiki, in order to compile quick and easy fix.

In a more general way, i'd like this sub to turn to a more friendly, open to discussion place than just a ""***i need help***"" subreddit.

Any ideas to improve the sub are welcome."

Hello  So at the start of this year I built a rig for both gaming and  workstation task like 3d modelling and whatnot My mom gifted me a 2060  after that and I have been using it since I encountered no real problem  with GPU mostly because I haven't played any game that would test it's  capabilities properly ( CSGO, DOTA2, League of legends were what I  always played) Until I reinstalled Rise of the Tomb Raider And I maxed  everything out for 1080p And I couldn't go past the first ice mountain  peak without my fps crashing below 45 frames I looked up other people  and benchmarks for ROTTR and I saw them play at Max settings with  constant 90fps

I tried fixing the issue but no matter what I do My GPU cannot perform as well as the benchmarks and videos I saw others do.

Can someone help me figure out how to fix this?

pcgamingtechsupport,I only want to spend around 500 bucks and i have a 60 Hz monitor. I do not know if I should just use my same monitor and buy an RTX 2070 super or buy a cheap 144 Hz monitor and get an RTX 2060 super along with it
pcgamingtechsupport,I just want to know for my new build
pcgamingtechsupport,"My build is:

Motherboard MSI B350 PC  
Processor Ryzen 5 1600 - default cooler  
RAM Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8) 3200mhz  
Power supply EVGA 500W 80plus  
SSD Sandisk 240GBHDD 1 WD Blue 1tb  
HDD 2 Seagate Barracuda 4tb  
Case Sentey 3283 

Ok, so I'm desperate. I decided to clean my PC, I cleaned the dust with a cloth and a few cotton swabs without disassembeling it, then removed the processor already sticked to the cooler with the thermal paste (i didn't separate them). I used a cotton swab to remove the dust through the heat sink and then connected the cpu again. It was kinda hard to align the processor and the socket because I didnt remove the motherboard from the case and I had the cooler attached to the processor, but eventually I got it. Apparently I couldn't screw the cooler into the motherboard because the (panel?) which has the little sockets for the cooler screws kept falling out and the sockets weren't high enough to reach the screws. I pushed that panel with a little plastic box and screwed them correctly. Then I closed the case and when I tried to turn the pc on, but it didn't. Not even a sound. Also when I took the processor/cooler out, the little lever that's supposed to be raised to take the processor out was down and, when I installed it again (as i had the cooler sticked to it), I didn't raise it to screw it into the motherboard.

&#x200B;

I searched online and I tried a few things. I made sure I was connecting the current cable correctly, to a functional outlet, and that I had the power supply botton on the I position. Then I tried removing the BIOS battery in for a few minutes and then connecting it again. I also tried removing the current cable, maintaining the power switch button pressed for 30 seconds, then connecting it again. Nothing. I tried using a screwdriver to bridge the Power Switch pins on the motherboard, but nothing happened. Then I tried to bridge the green and black sockets from the ATX20 connector with a piece of wire and all the case fans turned on, but not the processor fan (which is correctly connected) neither the graphics card fan. The drives seemed to work because they made some sort of sound but then again, nothing else happened. I tried removing everything, leaving only the cpu and the motherboard connected and tried to bridge the power switch pins again, and nothing happened. It seems like trying to bridge the motherboard pins never turns the pc on. Now I removed the processor again just ot make sure I didn't bend any pins or something, but everything seems to be fine.

I’ve been using this old laptop with an i3 and internal graphics to play WoW classic. 

It’s actually chugging along pretty nicely despite being old and not having a gpu, just internal graphics; definitely playable while solo leveling, but I’d like to upgrade. 

I understand playing on a laptop with internal graphics is always going to be far from perfect, but I’m not working with much money so it seems I don’t have the funds for a laptop with a gpu.

I’m looking at some used laptops on eBay and it seems I can get a used one with an i5 for $150 ish. 

Would going from an i3 to an i5 laptop (just internal graphics, no gpu) show a big enough performance increase in WoW classic to throw $150-$200 at it?

Any other tips or recommendations for specific laptops is appreciated. 

(They’re might be some confusion to people who don’t play the game. It’s an old game but it’s based on a newer engine so recommending anything that was good when it came out around 2004 won’t cut it)

So I built a PC for my sister in the first half of November as a Christmas present. It worked fine. I booted it up, got Windows installed, ran benchmarks, did all the usual stuff. I even left it on for a few hours while games installed.

I booted it up multiple times throughout December, just to see if it still worked. I thought the worst possible thing would be her opening it on Christmas and it doesn't boot...

It comes to Christmas, we plug it all in and we boot it. All seems fine. Not even 5 minutes in, **Windows 10 freezes**, goes to a **black screen**, **all USB devices power off** and I have to **flick the PSU switch to shut it off**. We try to boot it again and **5 minutes in it does the same thing**. Except this time, when we boot it, **there is no display**.

Also, the **fans usually slow down** about 2 seconds after powering on, they **don't do that anymore**. The **EZ Debug lights on the motherboard change every time we try and re-boot the PC**. Sometimes it will read **CPU**, others **DRAM**, sometimes **VGA & DRAM** are lit at the same time.

I tried re-seating the CPU, re-seating the RAM, using different RAM, trying different RAM slots, trying to boot without GPU, using on-board graphics, double checking all the motherboard connections, booting with no SSD, trying a different drive, clearing the CMOS, trying a different CMOS battery, trying a different PSU.

None of this changed the outcome.

I'm thinking it's either a bad motherboard or a (somehow) dead CPU. It just baffles me how it was working perfectly fine since I built it, and the instant I give it to her, it just dies.

If anyone could give there own perspective on the issue, that would be much appreciated, thank you and I hope you had a good Christmas."

pcgamingtechsupport,"I've been wracking my brain on this issue for a little over a month now, and I have made no progress other than ruling things out. I'll try to keep my description simple but I can answer any questions and offer any requested information.

Symptom: My wife and I, on our two separate gaming PCs, consistently experience frame drops and hanging at the same time. The performance problem is more common in the evenings. This includes when we are playing single-player games, or online games.

Things ruled out: 

* Network latency - this problem occurs even when both our PCs are off the network and playing single-player campaigns.

* Resource exhaustion - Performance monitors on both PCs show no excessive usage of disk, RAM, GPU, or CPU during the frame drops / hanging

* Video drivers, antivirus software, Windows updates vary between the two machines and they do not have these in common.

When the hanging / frame drops occur, it's almost like the system doesn't see it happening. For example, when she is playing Overwatch and it occurs, there is no rubberbanding, and performance metrics show a consistent 100 FPS. When I'm playing DOOM 2016, I am unable to move the camera, frames drop, and I continue to move in whatever direction I was going for a few seconds. Again, the performance metrics displayed in-game do not show any frame drops, despite being able to see them.

The final straw, and the reason I'm asking for help, was that I decided to hook up my Nintendo Switch to my main PC monitor and play some Smash. I seriously ran into the same frame drops at the same time my wife experienced them.

How is this possible? What can we check or rule out? Is it possible we are experiencing power brown-outs (our PCs are on two different outlets but I'm sure they connect to the same circuit in this small apartment)

Any help or ideas are greatly appreciated, since anything at this point, no matter how crazy, can point us in the right direction. Thanks!"
pcgamingtechsupport,"I was wondering if a combination of FPS limiting and Latency minimizing software would be okay for FPS competitive play. 

I have set latency to ultra in NVIDIA Control panel. I've capped FPS at 141 since I have a 144 hz monitor and have heard that it is best to cap 3 below max refresh. 

Is it better to do it this way or let the GPU and CPU work unconstrained?

pcgamingtechsupport," 

So I was playing valorant and the game froze. I went to my other monitor which was fine and opened tasked manager but it opened behind the game. Because the game was frozen I couldn't end it because it was behind, so I ALt F4 and it didn't do anything. I restarted my pc and everything closed as it should.Nonetheless, when I the system reboots I start noticing something strange. I got the OS on my SSD and games and other things in the HDD. The pc booted quick as usual but then I couldn't open the folders as fast as before nor I could open Task Manager as fast as before.I quickly opened valorant again and the game wouldn't launch, was stuck on ""Not responding"". Then I'm like ""Ok..."" so I tried another game COD MW and for some reason I was getting half or 2/3 of the frames I usually get. Then I updated NVIDIA drivers (I wasn't that outdated) and updated windows then restarted again.

PC is still slow and I notice that the task bar with the icons flicker when I touch it or go to ""Type here to search.""Another thing I notice is that when I open task manager for the first time after each restart, ""System Interrupts"" reaches CPU usage 50%-70% and then goes back to normal using a 0.7%. In idle CPU is sitting at \~30-40% usage using 1 google chrome tab.

I don't hear anything wrong inside the PC and the temp is fine, its not hot at all.I have't cleaned installed Windows 10 yet cause I want to try and fix this without this.

So, I'm trying to download games, play l4d2, play fortnite, and anything else game related but they won't seem to load and download speeds appear to be throttled heavily and consistently (pictured below)

. Getting on the internet works fine through browsers (streams load up instantly even), speed tests all come back fine. it sounds ridiculous but it's anything involving games. Steam, battlenet launcher, epic launcher. I've tried changing my dns server, uninstalling recent programs. restarting my pc mutiple times. no dice. 

What I find really odd is the blizzard launcher is super slow to load up, but once I actually wait the 30 min it takes, I can load up overwatch and play with no lag whatsoever.

Had the computer for less than a year, problem started about 3 days ago. only programs I have installed since then were autohotkey and intel driver updates from their website (both of which I have uninstalled).

So basically my issue is that the computer will turn on and all the lights will work, but it won’t boot. It stays on a black screen. I have tested the monitor, got new cpu due to someone telling me that was problem, new motherboard for same reason, taken all of it apart multiple times only using 1 thing of ram and the bare minimum. The weirdest thing is that it boots sometimes. Like twice. I had it running for a couple mins a couple weeks ago but turned it off due to cpuz having a bug saying my cpu was on fire. So when it booted for the second time, all went well and I even got a tease at what that 1070ti can do. Sjhdjskskkd. Btw it only booted whenever it was outside the case both times. That leads me to believe that it was the case causing an issue, but then I think about how it should be booting outside the case as well. When I plug my speakers into motherboard for mobo beeps nothing happens. When I plug kbm in, they get no power. Btw to turn it on I’m shorting the power pin that goes to front io. I’m so sick of replacing new parts and about to give up on pc gaming as a whole after being a member for last 3-4 years.

so I just did an upgrade to my pc a month or so ago and installed a new 1tb Samsung 970 pro m.2 NVME into my pc for raid 0 config with my other 970 PRO. I had to move my GPU out to install the new drive once everything was physically installed I installed Windows 10. a few days later I noticed that I started getting this weird pixelization [https://imgur.com/a/ayUbda2](https://imgur.com/a/ayUbda2) of certain programs.

This only happens when they are in the background and I move the mouse over the background window or drag a window over it, once I click on the background window it goes away. I have reseated the GPU, checked drivers/reinstalled, swapped to known good cables/tried different connection types eg. HDMI, DP, USB-HDMI, the issue persists with all of these changes.

one thing that seems to get rid of it is changing windows scaling back to 100 percent however, I think that's just because it's too small to notice most of it happening. I did notice it a little bit in one program but the effect was quite lessened.

It doesn't seem to affect every program or even every color it only seems to be mostly dark colors of windows that are open but in the background. so far I have seen it in twitch, photoshop, thunderbird, vortex mod manager. I am certain there are others I just haven't noted down or used yet.

is this indication of a GPU failure or just bad scaling I never saw it prior to this last upgrade.  could it also be the display is failing? I haven't got another to test with right now. so if there is a way to check it in a different manner that would be helpful.

pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi guys,

I recently built a PC after almost 15 years out of the gaming world. Besides questionable components choices, I think I was too cheap when it came to choose components for the ventilation.

First of all, these are my PC specs.

* MOBO: MSI X470 Gaming Pro Max
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X
* RAM: 2x 8GB G.Skill Trident Z RGB set to 3200 MHz in dual channel via XMP
* GPU: ASUS ROG Strix EVO Gaming OC RTX 2060 Super
* CPU cooler: **Cooler Master Hyper 212 RGB Black**
* Additional fans: 3x Nfortec Oberon ARGB PWM on the front pushing air. 2x of the same on the top pulling air out and one on the back exhausting air.

I live in a very hot area of Spain and even though it isn't summer yet we've already reached low 30º Celsius. Yesterday evening, with the windows open and a very nice fresh breeze from the outside, my room was a 18º and I did some stress tests using AIDA64.

My CPU peaked at 87º Celsius with Precision Boost Overdrive turned on and sat stable at 82º in a prolongued (5 min.) run. My GPU paked at 77º using Furmark GPU stress test in OC mode (1860 MHz). I understand those temperatures are still safe BUT summer is on the corner and I'm afraid they won't be as reasonable when it's 42º outside so I want to improve my CPU and GPU temp.

I've been doing a lot of research and came to the conclusion that there's not a huge difference in performance between a good air cooler (let's say Noctua NH-D15) and a decent AIO like NZXT Kraken X53 (my case won't support bigger AIO than 240mm) but I wanted to know your thoughts. 

I wonder if that big chunk of metal which is the air cooler radiator is on the way and having more clear room with an **AIO + a push & pull** setup would help cooling down CPU (likely) and maybe even the GPU. I can also add an **additional fan to the back of the radiator** or ultimately I can just mount the above mentioned **Noctua NH-D15**.

What would you do?

Thanks a lot in advance for your help!

pcgamingtechsupport,hello i have issues with some games my computer freezes and restarts without a bsod
pcgamingtechsupport,"Hey guys,

im a professional esport player and have played on many different PCs already throughout my career on LANs, Gaming Houses etc etc, and ive never come across this specific problem.

&#x200B;

Im running a high tier Rig consisting of:

i9 i9900k @ 5GHz, Asus Strix 2080ti, Asus Strix Z390-F, 16Gb G.Skill TridentZ 3200 OC @ 3700, cl16, Samsung EVO 970

Im using an AW2518HF @ 240HZ and a cheap Medion 60Hz Monitor as my second one.

Now as you can see in the title, despite high FPS and constant Frametimes theres a generally very unsmooth mouse feeling, that prevents me from aiming accurately. Also when looking around in games, it tends to feel very blurry and almost stuttery, making it hard to spot enemies or get that smooth gaming feeling when moving ingame. It is not visible in graphs or video material however, but very noticable when playing anyhow. I could describe the feeling best by saying: Its like there is a certain resistence when aiming and moving my mouse ingame. This problem persists no matter the game. Its incredibly noticeable in fast paced shooters like apex, where its hard to use my reaction speed to any advantage since it takes so long to process the unsmooth feeling and use my aim, and less noticeable in games like PUBG. Its also impossible to aim pixel perfect. When aiming from one point to another, i really have to almost claw the mouse to have it under control because the mouse movements feel so unsmooth and inaccurate.

Now the weird part: Last week that problem suddendly just completely vanished. For 2 days every game and aiming was completely smooth, just as I was used to playing on stage or gaming houses. I immediately noticed how everything came back and gaming was like it was supposed to. It was addicting. I remember unplugging my second monitor around that time, because I was testing If it had any performance impact. Not sure if that was the cause. I also remember that the frames around that time were especially constant, and when moving and turning around in game i had no stutters and no frame drops at all. I dont remember installing or uninstalling any software or drivers. I tried everything to simulate the state my pc was in at that point, but never got back to it since.

&#x200B;

What i tried:

\- Fresh Windows 2x

\- Flash GPU Bios

\- Bios Reset

\- Try with OC and without OC on both RAM and CPU

\- Different Monitor Cables (HDMI; DP) / 1 Monitor Setup, Tried Single Monitor Performance in Nvidia Inspector

\- Fresh Nvidia Drivers, Different Versions (436.11 / 441 / 442 )

\- different RAM (weirdly when trying to use G.Skill 3600 cl15 RAM, my PC didnt boot anymore and I had to boot Windows from a stick and reinstall everything)

\- different mice and keyboard

\- a lot of other obvious things

&#x200B;

Im kind of at a loss of sanity here. I know im not imagining these things, but its impossible to prove without any kind of indication of the problem in terms of performance. Im running APEX and PUBG at 240 FPS and 160FPS+ constantly and it still feels absolutely horrible.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any Idea what I can do?

When going to blue screen view the driver that triggered the crash was hal.dll

I tried switching the ram slots used and this time it stayed on but didnt output anything to the monitor and my mouse only lit up for a second when I touched it (2nd issue). I took out the cpu and gpu and put them back in and I tried different combinations of ram slots and ram cards and it was always one of the two problems. Which RAM card I used didnt seem to effect anything but the slots did. After a bit of testing it stopped doing the 2nd issue. I then noticed that there were EZ debug LEDs on my motherboard. At first the fans spin fast and the LED corresponding to the cpu lights up. Then the fans slow down and the VGA LED lights up instead. Finally it hovers on the BOOT LED for a bit then turns itself off.

I was thinking this could either be a problem with the motherboard RAM slots or the slot's connection to the CPU or maybe there's a short circuit somewhere (maybe in the RAM slot?) or pehaps even a problem with the RAM sticks? Maybe a combination of two things? I really don't know as this is my first time building a computer and I'm just getting these ideas online. Any help or suggestions are appreciated!"
pcgamingtechsupport,"I was playing the outer worlds in my pc and streaming. Was playing at 1080p and the quality was preaty bad. Then I got to watch the stream video and the graphic quality was preaty different. So I starter searching how to make 1080p look good on 4k monitor and didn't find any resolution.
I know that I can never male 1080p look as good as native cuz the pixels need to spread but it look too bad to be real.
I played ps4 before and the full HD was preaty good, nothing to complain, but when it comes to pc it looks bad.
I think it's because on ps4 the monitor was the one who downscale and on pc it's the gpu.
Any solutions u guys can have please?

[Userbenchmark stuff](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/20256817)

I mainly play Fortnite and I get about 180-200 fps in-game, on all low settings, which is crazy low for a game like this I should easily be able to get 240fps annd sustain it constantly with my specs. Any help on what to do?

I have xmp enabled in bios, and I did the EZ tuning wizard thing and it's still way too low. Also my fans randomly speed up to max speed while idle."
pcgamingtechsupport,"I don't need everyone's sass towards Epic Games Launcher, I know its not as good as Steam, but I'm trying to play BL3 and I would super appreciate any help I could get with speeding this up. Its been downloading for about 10 hours and its still only just 40% of the way because its downloading between 100-200 kb/s on average vs my Steam average of 1 MB/s. This is extremely frustrating and I'm not sure what to do.

I checked Steam and its downloading where it should be, so its not just my internet being suckier than usual.

I'm getting ""Backend Connectivity Tests for [https://launcher-website-prod07.ol.epicgames.com/](https://launcher-website-prod07.ol.epicgames.com/)"" failures under Regional Endpoints in the troubleshooting page with no answers on how to fix it.

I reset the launcher and now its not giving me a download speed, but the number downloaded is changing. My ""read"" is also flat, but my write is going up to about 530 mb/s for a second or 3 at a time then going down to nothing before going up again and repeating. Edit: Now its back to showing that its downloading at an average of 200-300 kb/s then flatlining."
pcgamingtechsupport,"I have been wanting to try VR for a long time now so I decided to get Valve Index VR headset since it´s new controllers really seemed like a revolution in how we communicate with the virtual world and seemed to me like a new generation short to say. 

Yesterday I got an email saying the my headset is ready for shipping and I just needed to make the payment, I already made the decision to spend some of my saving in this new piece of technology a long time ago but now that I have the option to get it doubts are starting to raise.

Being very objective and leaving the hype a side It seems to me that VR at this moment in time is a very cool technology but even Index being the top notch of VR headsets looks kind of primitive in terms of it can become in the near future.

Many games look like fun but they also look like the kind of fun Kinect or Wii games offered. You start playing and games are really engaging and fun because of the new way of controlling your characters but seems like you play these games for a while and then you just get bored because instead on focusing on an engaging story and cool gameplay devs seem to have focus the core of the game in the way you control them and left many other aspects of what makes a good video game aside.

What is your opinion about this?

Do you really recommend to buy Index headset?"
pcgamingtechsupport,"hello,   so i have an MSi, GTX 1050, i7 laptop and last year i was running GTA V  with at least 60fps on high settings and i didnt play for at least 2  months, and now when i try to play i just lag a lot. like 2-30fps and  thats with the LOWEST settings, even Nvidia graphics are low. i updated  all of my drives and still very laggy. i thought about resetting my  latop to factory and i already put most if not all of my files in my  passport (4tb storage) and i guess im just wondering if there is a fix  or even if resetting my laptop would even fix it. if you have any  suggestions please comment thank youuuu

pcgamingtechsupport, I dont know why this is happening but I literally cant turn on my PC without unplugging my keyboard usb's first. I know it isn't just one of the usb's causing it because I tried turning it on with only one in (there is a USB to activate the keyboard USB and one to activate the power). I have a corsair k70. If you can help me out that would be great!
pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi, I bought an Xbox One bluetooth controller. I have successfully paired it with my PC and updated it, but when I tried to turn off the controller or the PC I noticed that the controller is no longer able to connect automatically. 

To do it again I have to remove the device from the associated ones and repeat the procedure.  

The PC has a bluetooth usb adapter, so I tried to connect the controller to my laptop and Android smartphone too. The result is the same.  

If I do the button test apparently everything works, as well as if I connect the controller with a USB cable.  

Is it a controller problem or am I doing something wrong? 

Thanks"

talesfromtechsupport,"I was thrust a laptop by an angry exec early this morning with him complaining that his laptop had locked up again. Normally we have a ticketing system in place for any and all tech issues. However when an exec wants something he bypasses the system because of RHIP. So I go through the normal routine of diagnosis and through my efforts I see that the issue is simply bad ram. I replace the ram and take the unit back to the exec. 

He tells me he refuses to take the unit unless I have made 100 percent sure that everything that was wrong with it is fixed. Internally I wanted to punch this man but I held it in and simply asked him what other issues he was having and pulled out a notepad. He ran through a load of issues that all screamed ""just run fkin ccleaner"" to me and I took his unit back to my desk. 

After going through and cleaning out BS installed programs used literally once and never again and cleaning out junk data, I found that a folder in his roaming was reading 12GB but was hidden. I log in with my creds and enable viewing hidden or protected files and I see that the hidden folder was from 2014. Basically it was just a bunch of pictures and looked to be a temp folder created by one of the old programs I removed. Some kind of picture manager or some such. 

Normally when we see personal pictures on the machine we are supposed to delete them immediately. Now no one EVER does this as we are not that big of dicks in the IT dept. Plus this guy was an exec so I decided to just move the pictures to his desktop under a folder I created called Old Pics. 

I took the laptop to him and informed him of the pics telling him I left it up to him if he wanted them deleted or not. He thanked me for my time and I went back to work. 

About an hour later him and his wife, who had come up to join him for lunch, came over to my desk. He seemed very happy and she was crying. 

Now normally when I have nothing to do and a boss comes over, I stand up to greet them. Just the way I was raised I guess. I was not prepared for what followed and was totally shocked by the outcome. 

The lady wanted to thank me for finding the pictures and the exec reached out to shake my hand thanking me profusely before pulling me into a hug in front of the entire IT department. I awkwardly hugged him back and he let me go embarrassed. My eyes are wide flabbergasted and totally unprepared for this, extremely, out of character moment from this guy. 

Barely able to hold back the tears, his wife tells me that the pictures I recovered were thought to be lost. In 2012 their 4 year old son had died of lukemia and the pictures I recovered were taken right before his diagnosis at 3 years of age. Because of a  house fire a few years ago they thought they lost every last photo of their son. Apparently those were the photos I had recovered. 

His wife reached out to hug me and everyone in the IT department stared at their screens hard with puffy eyes as we were all not expecting this kind of emotional event today.

My boss came out of his office to personally thank me and forwarded an email chain to me ahead of a company wide email that the CEO sent out basically retelling the tale while naming me personally. He threw in words about striving for excellence and the unexpected results of every day excellence. 

I had to turn off my skype for business as the attaboys kept coming in one after the other. My boss told me to take my lunch early since the flood of messages was making it hard to do my job. 

EDIT: Post this before lunch one day, don't log into reddit for a bit, realize post went nuclear. RIP inbox. Thanks for the gold you 9 kind redditors. "
talesfromtechsupport,"I work in a store that offers technical support for consumer-level technology.

A few days ago I had an elderly gentleman that we'll call Pete (name changed for privacy). Our receptionist made him a walk-in appointment earlier that day and I ended up taking it. When I opened it all up, the only notes I saw were ""Third-party software, hard of hearing.""

I walked up to Pete and greeted him, saw that he was staring at my lips as to read them, then I asked if he knew American Sign Language (ASL). I've been trying to learn ASL it as a sort of side-hobby for a few months now. Pete signs ""yes"" and we continue the conversation in Sign. Turns out the issue is with Skype, which keeps crashing on his roughly 5-year old tablet, and he's been having difficulty video-calling his wife who is Deaf.

She lives in a different continent, she travelled there for a temporary work opportunity and would be there for two years. This being the mid-way point, it's now been 1 year since Pete's seen his wife. Skype is the only way they both know how to communicate efficiently long-distance, as neither are comfortable with email or other text-based services.

As I go through verifying that he knows his password and making sure there's a backup of his device, Pete and I are signing back and forth and his face was completely lit up. I felt so good to be able to, albeit slowly, speak with him in his language and give him the time he deserved, even if his reason for visiting us had little to do with our physical product.

Once everything was verified and backed up, I uninstalled Skype and reinstalled it, had Pete sign in, and use Skype's test call to ensure it wouldn't crash (as it would immediately upon call creation before). Test call went through fine. Sweet.

I looked down to write a few extra notes and began to hear some coughs. I looked up and there was Pete, crying while waving to his wife through Skype. Pete called her and she picked up! He introduced me to her and told me that it'd been 3-weeks since they'd heard from each other. I stepped away to give him a moment alone.

It's moments like these that keep me going as a technician. Even though I barely touched Pete's tablet, ""fixing"" it made me feel like a hero. It's been a few days and I can still see his smile.

Just thought I'd share, thanks for reading.

Obligatory: Wow, this exploded overnight! Thank you all for your kind words. Seeing the response I've gotten from all of you has made this experience even better! You guys are an amazing community."
talesfromtechsupport,"I work as an Executive Support Technician for a large company, I have a team of 8 people under me and we support high ranking executives and their administrative assistants.


Because of the nature of our work, we have the ability to ""get things done"" that the standard help desk cannot, We can force upgrades that would otherwise be denied, get things expedited, skip the normal procedures and talk directly with the people who fix the issues. 


While we are executive support, there are still levels, when the CEO is in town, one of us is camped outside of where ever he might be in case there is any sort of issue. 

For lower people, we make sure things get done as quick as possible, but it's not a drop everything situation.

As we prepped for the releases of the new iPhones, we braced for the flood of ""I NEED this"" that inevitably happens.  We slot in orders immediately for the top of the pyramid guys, and then work our way down, replacing, or sometimes having to tell them that they have to wait because the device they have is too new to warrant replacing. 

So on Monday, the EA of a lower end Exec put in a request to get both herself and the exec new 256 Gig iPhone X's

The Exec was put on the approval list, with a wait, but the EA was denied.  She had just been issued an iPhone 7 a few months ago, and she began to raise hell about ""I have to support him, so I need to have the exact same phone etc etc"" 

Still denied.

On Tuesday, I get a ticket from the EA - iPhone will not turn on, require replacement with attached ticket for iPhone X request.

I send one of my drones out to investigate and I immediately get a text saying I have to get out there, I get out there and the iPhone is wet, not just wet, but dripping wet, like just pulled out of a glass of water wet with a screen that could only be called heavily Cracked.

the EA states ""I was using it and it fell into my water bottle"" 

So we take the phone back to our area and I've called my manager over and we explain it, It's obvious what has happened,  We've toweled it off and when we turn it over, water drizzles out of the cracked screen. 

Well as luck would have it, we have spares, so I pluck a nice 64 gig Rose Gold iPhone 6s that was returned when the previous owner departed the company, I call and have the sim reprovisioned, I re-assign the phone in Airwatch and I have the phone returned to the EA.

10 minutes later, said EA is at our door, ranting, screaming saying that she can't work like this, she needs a new phone and if we don't give her one ""EXECUTIVE"" will make us give her one.  I step in and tell her ""A permanent replacement is just beginning the process, we have had to issue you this phone as a loaner so you can continue working until a permanent replacement is sourced""

Queue Wednesday, the approval process has come back denied for her replacement, the loaner phone is now her permanent phone.  This info is relayed to the EA, who is fuming, lots of ""EXECUTIVE WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS"" and statements of ""I can't believe this is happening to me, how will I work?"" 

Wednesday afternoon, same EA, new ticket - iPhone broken, need replacement.  I head out myself to see the issue and the phone looks like it was dragged behind a semi truck for 100 miles, the screen is shattered, a big chunk missing out the top near the camera, big dents in the back.  I calmly ask ""What happened? This phone was perfect this morning?""

The reply: ""Well, since you gave me an old phone, my case didn't fit and it slipped out of my hands and fell down the stairs.""

Well ok, could you tell me when and what stairwell this happened? she does, and I take the mangled phone, I grab my manager and we head off to the security office, and we pull the tapes.

On the video we see the EA walking up the stairwell (concrete stairs, metal hand rail, your typical big building non public stairwell) she reaches the top and proceeds to fling the phone, like one would skip a stone, down from the 6floor to the mid floor landing, where it lands, she steps on it and then kicks it down to the 5th floor, it bangs off the metal fire door and she picks it up, examines it and then tosses it down the stairs to towards the 4th floor, bouncing off a few steps before landing on the mid landing between 5 and 4.

She picks the device up, and pries a large section of something off the phone (We suspect this was the chunk missing by the camera) and then heads back up the stairs, running the phone against the cinder block wall as she climbs. 

So we grab a copy of the video, we head straight to HR, we sit with the personnel director, we show her the video, we show her the 2 damaged iPhones, we show her the tickets, I relay the abuse thrown to myself and my techs about how she demands an iPhone X and has taken to destroying company property to get it. 

Termination follows, however the user has gone home for the day, her accounts are disabled, her security badge flagged.  

7:30 am today, the EA attempts to get into the building and her badge does not work, so she has to walk to the security office, the security officer takes the badge, and walks her to HR.

8 am, the Security officer and two members of HR are escorting the EA out of the building, she's alternating between yelling and crying, Demanding that EXECUTIVE be called and that she's being framed.

As she's brought through the main foyer, I'm on the 2nd floor balcony that overlooks the entrance, she looks up at me, curses me and is gone.

Both phones, her laptop and other equipment have been placed with the Legal team as a precaution. Company policy when there is a messy separation.

Maybe I'll buy my team pizza for lunch today, seems like the right thing to do.

TLDR; Executive Assistant breaks iPhones in her quest to get an iPhone X, gets unemployment instead. "
talesfromtechsupport,"LTL FTP, etc.This happened last year, but a recent post elsewhere sparked the memory

Little Background: I work IT at my college, usually I work in back so I don't have to deal with people, but once a week I get to grace the helpdesk. My school gives it's students a lot of privacy and they can decide what the school can release to other people when they come for orientation, it ranges from we're an open book to we can't verify the students existance. This student selected, we cannot verfy his existance which applies to everyone that is not an immediate family member.


So be me, bored out of my skull watching the minutes tick by of the last 5 minutes of my shift, ready to get dinner. I get a call from whom shall be known as $apache (very agressive helicopter parent, hence attack helicopter).


**$me**: Thank you for calling $myschool ITS help desk how can I help you


**$apache**: Hello! My name is $Apache and my son goes to the school, but is having trouble logging in to $ouronlinepanelforstudents can you give me his password?


**$me**: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble however we do not keep students passwords on record, however if he is having issues with it he can reset it online, call us, or come down to $buildingwe'rein to come get it fixed!


**$apache**: OK can I get it reset then? He really needs to get in


**$Me**: I'm sorry but it has to be him who asks to get it reset, I can't do it for anyone else


**$apache**: But I'm his mother, I can get it reset for him


**$me**: I'm sorry but it _has to be him_ who comes and gets it reset, it can't be anyone else, even his immediate family


**$apache**: But I'm his mother, I've done everything for him


**$me**: I understand that, but college policy states that only the student can request a password reset


**$apache**: I'M HIS GODAMN MOTHER YOU INCOMPETANT PEICE OF SHIT, GIVE ME HIS GODAMN PASSWORD


At this point I know it's about to get fun, I look back at my manager, who is totally awesome and loves stuff like this, and signal her to get on the line and listen.


**$me**: I understand your frustration, however I can't go against college policy, I would reccomend that you call your son and tell him to call us to get is password reset. 


**$apache**: NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME YOU LITTLE SHIT, IF YOU DON'T RESET 
$hersonandpersonIknow's PASSWORD RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO GET YOU FIRED


Her son was one of the guys who lived on my floor and I knew, but wasn't really friends with.


**$me**: Ok, let me talk to my manager and see what I can do.

I go back to my manager who is already smiling about this lady, and I tell her I know this guy and if it's alright to text him and let him know that his mom is on the phone asking to chage his password. Since its about his account she says go for it.


**$me** -> **$myfriend**: Yo buddy your mom is on the phone cursing me out cause I won't change your password, did you need it reset?


**$myfriend**: What no. I know my password, why is she calling you?


**$me**: She's saying you forgot your password and is now going off the walls, I put her on hold and I'm sure she's steaming at this point


**$myfriend**: Wait, what's her name?


**$me**: $apache


**$myfriend**: lol that's not even my mom it's my stepmom. 


If you remember from the very beginning this student had selected the ""I dont exist to the outside world"" privacy package, so now we could have even more fun with the attack helicopter parent

_back on the phone_


**$me**: Hello $apache?


**$apache**: Yes! What took you so long!!


**$me**: Sorry I was just looking over some information and I don't see you on our files anywhere being related to any of our students.


**$apache**: So what! I just want my sons pasword!


**$me**: I'm sorry, but we have parents of our students on record and youre not on any of them


**$apache**: $student is my step-son! That's a son!


**$me**: I'm sorry, we can't release any information at all to anyone that's not an immeditate family member. 


**$apache**: He goes to the school and I'm his mother! Give me his password!


**$me**: I'm sorry I cannot verify $student's enrollment at our school.


**$apache**: WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN YOU LITTLE SHIT, I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU FIRED.


At this point my manager is giving me the ""cut the call"" sign so I just tell her:


**$me**: I'm sorry I couldnt be more help, thank you for calling $school. Have a nice rest of your day


**$apache**: DON'T HANG UP ON ME YOU LITTLE SH-   *click*

talesfromtechsupport,"Another tale from the out of hours IT desk...

**Me:** Service Desk

**Caller:** GOOGLE BING ISNT WORKING IS THE SYSTEM DOWN ??? ITS VERY IMPORTANT I USE THE BING

*Note: yes, caller actually said ""the bing""*

**Me:** I'm sorry - can you confirm which system you're referring to as I'm unfamiliar with that

**Caller:** Google Bing! Really how can you not know this

**Me:** Google Bing is not a system we support out of hours nor in hours. This sounds like a mash up between two different search engines. What exactly is happening?

**Caller:** I need Google Bing to do my job! This is unacceptable. I can't find Google Bing anywhere on my PC. How dare you remove this! I need you to fix Google Bing immediately!

**Me:** May I remote in to take a look

<spend 5 mins setting up remote connection>

Turns out that caller had a shortcut on her desktop called ""Google Bing"" - this opened the Bing Search homepage in Google Chrome *shivers*. She'd accidentally changed the name of the shortcut from ""Google Bing"" to something else and hence could not find it.

**Me:** okay - that has been renamed now so you're good to go

**Caller:** next time don't mess around with my computer! I know you guys changed this, I'm not stupid! I have a certificate of proficiency in computering

**Me:** okay thanks for calling *click*

*Note: yes caller really said ""computering""*

I died a little inside after taking this call."
talesfromtechsupport,"This just happened...

So, I had a laptop system board fail. Under warranty. No problem.

10 minutes later, I'm called down to where he was working by a member of management saying that he must have been doing drugs in there because there's a syringe in the bin. There's about 10 members of staff all freaking out.

talesfromtechsupport,"I work Helpdesk for a retail store chain in the UK. I had a call from a store about a till drawer that wasn't opening after a transaction.

>me: Could you check that the till is plugged in to the back of the pc?

>user: Sure, one second.. (I hear him rummaging under the desk)

>user: yeah, It's plugged in

*The POS software occasionally forgets which COM port to operate for the till drawer*

>me: I'm just going to try to open the drawer manually. Can you stand back from the drawer so it doesn't hit you.

Whenever I want to reach through the screen and smack a user, I'll always think back to this story and remember that it's possible."
talesfromtechsupport,"So my story starts on what was a normal day taking calls on the front line for a large cable company.  The job pays well and for the most part the people I deal with are fairly nice to talk to.

Quite often we'll get calls from seniors (especially in the morning) who have premise equipment issues such as ""snow on screen"" or ""no signal"" on their TV sets connected to our digital equipment. 

Now my heart does go out to some of these folk because up until recently (past few years) we would supply straight analog cable to many homes (coax direct from wall to TV with scrolling guide).  However most cities we service nowadays require our digital equipment to receive channels, and this has caused a lot of frustration with older people who don't know how to operate said equipment (ie. always having your TV set on ""video"" or ""hdmi"" to get picture).  So often times we get customers who are repeat offenders with long ticket histories of these types of issues.

So anyway, I get a call from an older gentleman who's quite bitter and mean right off the bat (doesn't like that I asked for his address / telephone number to verify the account, hates that he has to speak with a machine before reaching an agent, etc.).  I have some experience handling these types of customers, however this call was going to be a little different.

I spent over 45 minutes with this guy (we'll call him Mr. Smith) trying to get his TV set connected to the digital box properly so he could receive a picture.  No luck.  He was getting clearly frustrated by the whole ordeal and started blaming me for not being able to do my job properly, how I was useless, etc. 

Whatever.

Like I said, I've dealt with this before so I tried my best not to take it personally, but eventually I had to ask him if we could book a service tech to the home (a courtesy call) to get his TV working correctly.  Unfortunately, our booking calendar was showing an appointment 3 days out.   That's when he dropped this on me:

""Don't bother sending a goddamn technician, because I'll be dead by then.  I'm 94 and TV is the only thing I have left, are you really going to make me wait for a tech?""

I instantly felt bad.  I mean, I've heard every complaint in the book as to why people don't want to wait for a tech but this one kind of got to me.  I'm in my mid-20's so honestly I can't even imagine how it must feel to utter those words.

So I spoke with my supervisor, who said they'd see if we could get someone out earlier...but we couldn't promise anything.  So I let Mr. Smith know and he was predictably not very happy with my answer.  

At that point it almost sounded like he started to cry and went into how he has no family left, and no friends that come visit (this was after I asked if there was anyone in his building that might be able to help).  Man.  I felt terrible, so I took it upon myself to ask Mr. Smith if I could pay a visit (he lived in a small city over from where I was, not very far to drive).  

He was a little shocked I was willing to do this, but sounded thankful I was willing to come out and help him personally.

So I head over, get to the residence and meet him - within 30 seconds I had the cable running again (simple input change) and even brought him a simplified remote for his set top box to avoid this problem in the future.

That's when he started crying.  He goes into how he hasn't actually spoken or really interacted with anyone for years.  He gave me a hug and told me how thankful he was that I came out and helped him, and told me how sorry he was for being so mean earlier on.  I said it was no problem and I was happy to help, and that was it - I left.

3 weeks later, my supervisor comes to my desk and asks me if I could come speak with her for a bit about an account for ""Mr. Smith"".  Turns out, he sent the cable company a letter outlining how thankful he was for helping him with his issue and how it really ""made an old man happy again for once in a very long time"".  The letter was framed and put on our front entrance to retail.

I guess the moral of this story is no matter how nasty someone is to you over the phone, sometimes they're not always a terrible person and just going through a lot.  I still think about Mr. Smith occasionally when I get those nasty customers and it makes me feel a little better.

Anyway thanks for reading just thought I'd share how this one call changed my outlook on life :)

> $Usr - Yes.

*Are you? Are you really? I am pretty sure you've left your brain cell at home though*

> $Me  - So select $TodaysDate from the calendar that pops up.  
> $Usr - Why?  
> $Me  - So that the $HRsystem knows that you're back at work and not still off sick.  
> $Usr - But I am back now.  

*Are you a rubbish chat bot sent to test me?*

> $Me  - You need to tell the HR system when you came back so it unlocks your profile.  
> $Usr - Can't it tell?  
> $Me  - How would it tell?  
> $Usr - Well I am in the building and logged into my computer, is that not enough?  

*This is a test, has to be a test, am I getting secret shoppered???*

> $Me  - The systems aren't linked in that way. People come into work all the time when off on holiday or sick to drop things off/collect things. If the system logged that as a day in work then holiday and sick pay would be all messed up. We also have a number of remote users who are never in the office.  
> $Usr - So how do I sort this out?  

*ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?*

> $Me  - Fill in the date field!!!!!

*I need to get out of this call!*

> $Usr - Would you mind. It might be easier.  

*Too F'in right it'll be easier*

*Please please please IT gods, don't do this to me*  

> $Me  - What's wrong with your password?

> $Usr - I don't want to change my password.  

*You did this to me...*

> $Me  - You have to change your password every 60 days.

> Dear sir:

> I apologize for the inconvenience, but I need to request file XYZ from you. My phone is having trouble recieveing emails, however, but I can receive the file by facebook message.

> Steve

Jack had been out of the office about twenty minutes when Boss forwarded this to me. I called him at his desk. ""Hey Boss. I just got the email you forwarded me. You need me to send file XYZ for you?""

""Yes. Can you...can you send people files on facebook?""

""Yes, I can. But I'll have to use the computer Jack's been using, though. It's the only one that can access facebook.""

""Right, right. I'll meet you in my wife's office.""

I hung up the phone and launched a single .bat file on my desktop. it ran its commands and then deleted itself as I walked away.

*

I got to Boss' Wife's office a few minutes later. I smiled to her and Boss before crossing to the computer. ""Give me a second to bring up facebook and then--"" I turned the laptop around to face us and Boss's wife reached over, moving the mouse. The screen flared to life.

Boss stared. Boss' Wife gasped. A soft moan, followed by the neigh of a horse, emanated from the laptop. She frantically closed the video window...revealing a second window underneath it; a Bing search for ""*best places to buy weed near me*"". She closed that one, too...revealing Buzzfeed's ""*10 signs you're over your job*"".

As she slammed the laptop shut, Boss shook his head, red and shaking with anger. ""How...How was that--I mean, I thought--WHO WAS USING THIS COMPUTER?"" he roared.

Boss's wife shook her head. ""Jack was using it about a half-hour ago..."" As as if on cue, Jack appeared in the doorway with the leftovers from lunch in a carryout bag in his hand.

Boss's back was to him. ""THAT KIND OF THING SHOULD BE BLOCKED!"" He yelled at me, pointing to the laptop.

I nodded. ""I agree. Jack said he needed to use the unrestricted computer for some important projects. That's why he asked you to retrieve the key to my desk last week, right?"" I pointed to the door with my chin and Boss saw Jack. 

Jack blinked at Boss. He looked at me. He looked at the computer. Then back to me. I could see it dawned on him what was going on. ""Y-you did something to my computer, didn't you?!"" He demanded.

Of course I had. I had copied a hidden batch file onto Jack's desktop from a USB drive when I ""fixed"" his computer the other day. A file that would send me his browsing history without remoting into his desktop or alerting him. Then, all it would need would be a remote command, which I'd set off from my own computer. The file would then delete itself after launching three web pages as soon as the mouse moved...three of the most incriminating web pages Jack had ever visited on the computer. All it needed was a remote command, which I'd set off from my own computer. Granted, it wasn't entirely untraceable, but the only person who'd know what to look for was in this room, looking with as angry a face I could muster at the awful end user who had become the bane of my existence.

Boss's wife chimed in. She was, at least, slightly more computer-savvy than her husband. ""No. Clickity didn't do anything. He just exited the...you know. The screensaver. Whatever was there must have been what you were...um...*working on* when you rushed out of the office for lunch."" she glared at Jack and then addressed Boss. ""He must have forgotten to close out the evidence of his *blatant* misuse of company property."" 

I shook my head solemnly. ""And I trusted you with this unrestricted computer, too, Jack. I even gave you your own email address for the company because I thought you'd be an asset. Clearly...clearly I was wrong."" I tried my best to sound hurt.

Boss's Wife nonchalantly picked up the laptop and handed it to me. ""Jack, I am rather upset that you'd do something like this. I hired you as a favor to your mother. And you can be certain she'll hear about this. Now go home.""

Jack stood there, shaking. He probably had an idea of what I had done, but he'd have no way to prove it. ""But...He...I..."" He pointed at me wordlessly.

""GET OUT!"" Boss yelled.

Jack burst into tears and ran from the room.

*

Now, as I write this, it's been four weeks since Jack was terminated. I ""patched"" the ""security hole"" from Spotify and the interns are listening to music again. I didn't give the spare desk key back to the office manager.  As for Jack...I saw him the other day when he stopped by with his mother. He came and knocked on my door.

""Um...Clickity?""

I looked up and narrowed my eyes. ""What.""

""I just...I wanted to say I'm sorry for...for saying that stuff and...acting like I did...""

I blinked.

""...and...um...now that I've apologized, I was hoping you could tell my mom that I didn't really look up any of that stuff. You...You know you're the one who did it. Not me. I mean..."" he took a breath. ""I mean, I've learned my lesson...so...""

*Seriously?*

""Come on, Clickity. She's made me get another job...and she cut my allowance...COME ON!"" He looked at me pleadingly. I almost felt sorry for him. Almost. Actually, not even almost.

I shook my head and went back to typing. Jack continued standing there, and after a few long moments I looked at him.

""You can go now.""

And then he was gone.

**Edit:** Clarity on my evil plan

**Edit 2**: Wow! 3 gildings on one post. You guys are the best.

talesfromtechsupport,"So I had a customer call me up in mobile tech support with the problem that his data wasn't working for 20 minutes, pretty quickly I find out why; he had accidentally turned off his data on the phone menu (which happens a lot but usually the customer goes ""oops silly me""). So this customer starts demanding that he want's compensation for his time without service and being very rude about it. After a couple of minutes he's not taking this is not something we did, but his mistake as a answer, so I get an idea, I tell him I'm going to go speak to my manager. I went up to my manager, explain what's happening, he says the customer's being ridiculous and I said, 

>""Listen I have this idea for him, are you okay with this?"" then explain my idea.

>""Are you kidding? Let me get on call listening before you go back, I wanna hear this.""

I go back to the phone, he gave me the thumbs up that he was ready to listen and I proceed.

>""Right sir, I just had a word with my manager and I've managed to swing something for you, so let's break this down, you pay us 39.99 a month for 3 services; calls, texts and data, so let's divide your bill by 3 that give us 13.33, so let's divide further by 30 days to gives 44 pence for your daily data, now you had your data turned off for 20 minutes but for the purpose of this I'll round it up to an hour so we just need to divide that 44 pence by 24 hours so that means your looking at compensation of 1.8 pence so let's just say 2.""

I looked over at my manager during and he was covering his mouth laughing. Customer goes;

>""Are you having a f@#king laugh?""

>""No sir the math is there.""

>""............Go on then I'll take it""

I hope you will forgive me for a third hand story, but I'm one of those evil developers, not a support per se. But I thought you'd enjoy this story anyway. So this happened to a colleague of a colleague:
 
**$Hero** - our hero. **$Cop** - A representative of our hard worked law enforcement agency.
 
So $Hero is happily speeding along in his car, running a few yellow lights a bit late, etc. Finally, the law catches up to him and pulls him over. Here's how the conversation went:
 
**$Cop**: Can I see your driving license, please?
 
**$Hero** (with smug grin): Certainly. Here it is, officer.
 
**$Cop** takes license back to motorcycle and speaks into radio.
 
**$Hero**: It's not going to help you any, though.
 
**$Cop** (with no reaction): What do you mean?
 
**$Hero** (with wider grin): The server you have to check it against is down.
 
**$Cop** (still no reaction): And why do you say that?
 
**$Hero**: Because I'm the guy they called to get on site and get it up again.
 
Our hero did not get a fine this time. Instead he got a police escort to his workplace."
talesfromtechsupport,"If this is the wrong sub, please let me know. 

I spent three shitty years working in a call center, two of which I was roped into acting as tech support, despite the fact that I'd originally been hired to sell insurance. The calls I got made me weep for humanity. After my son was born, I decided not to return from maternity leave. I just couldn't handle staying up all night with a screaming newborn, and then coming in to work and calmly asking people how the hell they can't see the huge red ""CREATE AN ACCOUNT"" button smack-dab in the middle of the page, but they can find our phone number in tiny font up in the corner to call and demand that we do it for them. 

Well, you guys, my baby is now a toddler, and I just had that misty-eyed, hand-on-heart, proud parent moment that you always hear about. My son was playing with his Brilliant Baby Laptop, which is basically a bright plastic clamshell that plays music when the baby mashes the keyboard. Suddenly, the music stopped. The baby was confused. Further button-mashing had no effect. I watched from the sofa as my son frowned, experimentally smashing the buttons harder. Then, as I looked on in amazement and pride, *he turned it off and on again.* ""Welcome!"" It announced, the screen lighting up in a joyful display. My son contentedly returned to his button-mashing, and I shed a proud tear. So what if your kid can say ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" and knows how to use a spoon? Mine can *troubleshoot!* "

**Caller:** HOLY CRAP THE SERVER ISN'T WORKING. THE. SERVER. ISN'T. WORKING. YOU ARE WASTING MY TIME.

(In the background I've already loaded up our server monitoring tools - no alerts)

**Me:** I've checked our monitoring, I'm not seeing any servers as being down. Which department are you calling from?

**Caller:** IRRELEVANT. FIX THE GOD DAMN SERVER NOW.

**Me:** Can I get your Staff ID please?

10 minutes later...

**Me:** Service Desk

**Caller:** HOLY CRAP THE GOD DAMN SERVER IS STILL DOWN!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS?

**Me:** Nothing.

**Caller:** EXCUSE ME? *NOTHING?* 

**Me:** You still haven't told me which server is down or what is not actually working?

**Caller:** YOU PEOPLE! IT'S OBVIOUS MY PHONE ISN'T WORKING I CAN'T MAKE CALLS. THE SERVER HAS GONE DOWN YOU NEED TO CALL YOUR PEOPLE AND FIX THIS.

**Me:** Ma'am I can see you are calling me from your Desk Phone, <ext> is that correct?

talesfromtechsupport,"LTLFTP+Hard to format on mobile.

Ok, so I am by no means an IT but the one who everyone in my family call when they need help.  
So I get a call from my grandpa (89 yrs old) about a new win 10 laptop he just got and he needs help setting it up.

Now keep in mind he is the kind of person to blame the machinery if he clicks on the wrong thing so I already knew this would not end in a phone call - so I drove to his place expecting to see it still in the box. That was not the case.

When I arrive, I see him already in his desktop, after he somehow managed to install windows correctly on his own accord - and waiting for me while playing minesweeper. As he greets me, he freaking ALT+F4's to close the game and then tells me he cannot connect to the internet.  
Not sure what happened in the week I wasn't there, I ask if he could show me the problem.

He then OPENS CMD AND PINGS HIS OWN CELLPHONE and then points at the 0 packets text to show me there is no connection.

At this point id probably look less surprised if I see an alien invasion.

So after showing him that you need to enter the password to connect to his home wifi, he then asks me how to see his email account again.  
Still completely stunned, I show him how to access his outlook account and how to delete some messages.

And the craziest part- when I asked him how did he know about CMD his answer was: ""I learned it from grandma"".

EDIT: I just asked granny about this whole thing and she does not remember. Unfortunately I will never know what supernatural being managed to teach them that."
talesfromtechsupport,"This happened awhile ago. I own my own computer repair business and a customer called me up asking me to build them a computer, they had all the parts and just wanted someone to put it together as they didn't trust them selves. It was a fairly high end computer, they spent probably $2000+ on parts. I put it together with no issues and they were very happy. When they picked it up they asked if I could fix up one of their older computers so their kids could play together. The computer they brought in was maybe 2-3 years old but for the time was top of the line parts and probably cost $2000-$2500, they bought an Nvidia GTX1070 and told me that it needs a hard drive and some extra fans. So I picked up a $100 hard drive, swapped in the 1070, installed the fans and it ran like a dream, I called them and told them it was ready, they were again really pleased and said they would be by later in the day. 3 days later I call them again and ask when they want it and they say they will be on the weekend. 7 days later they say they will be by at the end of the day. 2 weeks later I call and get no answer so I leave a message and send them an email explaining that starting at the beginning of next month there will be a $20/week storage fee since it's been over 30 days since it was completed. I call them in the middle of the week to again confirm when they wanted it and explain the fee, but no answer so I leave a message and text them. The week after I call and no answer so I leave another message, email, and text. On week 3 there was still no answer but they called me back 2 days later explaining there was a family emergency and they were out of town and they would be by within 2 days to pick it up, 3 days go by and they don't show up or call. On week 4 I call one last time and explain that this will be the last message they will get from me and I will hold on to the computer for 90 days at which point I will assume you don't want it and I will take ownership. So we are over day 100 and I now have a very good gaming computer for the low investment of $100.

EDIT: Because a few people are criticizing me of taking advantage of a grieving family, let me clarify; I don't know what the emergency was (for all I know it was some great aunt from Europe), and I have paper work to say it's the companies (mine) after 90 days. Now I pride myself on customer satisfaction so I called them numerous times to try and verbally let them know it was ready and if after a few months they contact me back asking for the computer I will give it back to them."
talesfromtechsupport,"Hey everyone, thought I would share this tale from one of my IT buddies. He had this one woman that would always puts tickets in for the smallest things. But this one takes the cake.

People:  
IT - IT Buddy  
CW - Confused Woman  

IT saw a ticket had come in and it was from CW. It said: ""You deleted all my files! I need them to do my job!"" IT called CW to see what was going on because we don't delete personal files off of people's computers unless there is a good reason for it and we have the user's permission. So while he was on the phone, he remotes into her computer and noticed everything but the recycling bin was missing on her desktop. He noticed that there was files in the recycling bin, so he opened it and all her files are there.

>IT: Here are all your files, did you move them into here?

>CW: Yes I did, I moved them in here to recycle them so they will be clean for me to work on them.

>IT: .....Excuse me?

>CW: Yes, I move them to the recycling bin to make them new again so I can reuse the files.

>IT: This is the trash bin, you would move files here to delete them off of your computer.

>CW: IT IS NOT A TRASH CAN, IT IS A RECYCLING BIN! IT SAYS SO RIGHT UNDER THE ICON!

So for the next half hour, my buddy had to teach her how to use the recycling bin."
talesfromtechsupport,"[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/61z2ns/how_i_got_fired_and_unfired_in_the_same_day/), I shared the story of how I got fired in a huff by someone who, to put it diplomatically, over-estimated his own authority - only for my termination to be rescinded by his manager a few hours later when she found out about it.  This one is the followup; set a year later, and is the story of how I finally ended up quitting that job. 

Cast of characters: 

* Me! I was a lead sysadmin at a very large telco, responsible for the email system at the corporate HQ. I was a contractor there, which will become relevant to the story later. 
 
* Jim (J in my last story)- an IT architect at a large telco. Jim was my primary customer contact until he flew off the handle and tried to fire me under circumstances that were dubious at best.  Jim was a pretty smart technical guy who was also a bull in a china shop who shouldn't have been allowed to work around other people. 
 
* Lynne (not in the previous story) - Lynne is the IT architect who I was assigned to work with after Jim screwed the pooch in my previous story. She was awesome, for reasons that will become clear soon. She reported to Jim, and utterly loathed him. 
 
* Marie (M in the previous story)- Jim's boss, the IT department manager. She unfucked everything after Jim fired me.     

In early 2000, I got a phone call at home from an IT recruiter. This wasn't uncommon at all - I had at one point or another interacted with half the sleazy recruitment agencies in my city.   This call was a little bit different.  It was from an in house recruiter for a tech company, a company that was one of the shining stars of tech where I lived, with a reputation for not only having solid technology in their market, but also being a great place to work. They were an honest-to-goodness ""unicorn"" (back before anyone called them that.)  The conversation went something like this: 

Recruiter: Hi Blempglorf, this is Recruiter with CoolTechCompany, how are you today?  
Me: Doing well, thanks, what can I do for you?
Recruiter: Blempglorf, I'm calling because Lynne gave me a copy of your resume, and suggested that I reach out to you about a position we have open.  

A bog standard HR introductory call followed, where I found out that they were looking for a lead Windows sysadmin for their internal IT department. 

Now this confused the shit out of me, because Lynne was my lead, albeit through a dotted line.  Let that sink in: my boss sent my resume to a recruiter without my knowledge or permission.  Obviously, this was something that warranted further investigation. 

So, I called Lynne. Apparently, she had just interviewed at CoolTechCompany, and didn't get the job.  On the ""thanks but no thanks"" call from HR, she told the recruiter something to the effect of ""Well, that's too bad, but I know someone else you need to talk to.  Blempglorf is better at this stuff than me, and I think he'd love working at CoolTechCompany."" And then she sent over my resume, which she had from when she referred me for an internal hire job in another division of the telco we both worked at. When I asked her why she did that she just said: ""You have to trust me on this one. I can't say more."" 

So I had a phone interview with the hiring manager at CoolTechCompany. And he and I meshed well, and he decided to bring me in for the full gauntlet interview with the rest of the sysadmin team there. 

Around this time, I got a meeting request from Jim, who I hadn't really interacted with a lot since the time he tried (and failed) to shitcan me.  At the meeting, Jim informed me that Telco had decided to insource all the contract sysadmins, and bring them on as direct Telco employees.  He had an offer letter waiting for me at the meeting. I opened the offer letter, only to discover that it was a 20% pay cut from what I was earning as a contractor, to do the same job.  There was a slight bump in terms of benefits value (from what I recall the 401k match was superior) but at first glance, it was obvious that this was a pay hit no matter how you added it up.  Jim also informed me that this wasn't optional, that the insourcing was going to happen whether I liked it or not, and that this was a ""take it or leave it"" offer. Not only would this be a pay cut, but I would also be reporting directly to Jim, as would all the other newly-insourced sysadmins on the team.  Either one of those would be dealbreakers, but I kept my mouth shut, knowing his history. 

I caught up with Lynne a few minutes later. She took one look at my face and knew what had just happened. ""This is why I told you to trust me."" she said, before I even said a word. 

I could have kissed her. 

So, a couple of weeks later I went in for the full interview at CoolTechCompany, which resulted in an offer that would have been a no brainer to accept even if I hadn't just had my pay cut. I received that offer just before the planned effective date of the insourcing (and pay hit.)

The next day, I walked in to Lynne's cube and let her know that I'd gotten the job. She got this look of utter delight on her face, and said to me: ""You HAVE to let me be there when you tell Jim.""  So, we walked over to his office together, and told him.  He looked absolutely floored, and as usually did when he didn't get his way, immediately went into argument mode. 

""All the other sysadmins took the job."" (True, but two others quit within the first two months because they didn't have the headstart on their job search that I did)
""You're making a big mistake""  (And why would that be?)
""Do you think that little company is going to last?""  (They did.)

The problem was that because of the planned insourcing, there was no mechanism to continue to pay me past the end of that week, as Telco's contract with the outsourcer was expiring. Enter Marie. Marie was Jim's boss, who I had a great relationship with. Now, I felt genuinely bad about this, because IT operations at corporate HQ was her responsibility, and this left her with not only no email server support, but only a day to figure out how to ensure continuity. (My backup had quit for unrelated reasons a month before.) I was perfectly willing to give 2 weeks notice per custom, mind you - they just didn't have a straightforward way to pay me for it. 

So, Marie called me into her office, after Jim had left for the day. I told her that I was already in the interview process at the time Jim gave me the offer (This was true, although I left out the whole part about Lynne.), and the fact that it was such a big pay cut made it a no-brainer to continue the process. Marie had an utterly stunned look on her face, and she said to me: ""Pay cut?  You all were supposed to be kept at parity.""  

What I found out later (through my mole Lynne) was that Jim neglected to relay that instruction to company HR when they were preparing the offer letters.  They prepared the offers at what HR deemed to be market rate, which in this case was a substantial pay hit. I never found out if he did that on purpose, but given that he'd complained in the past that he thought we were overpaid for what we did, I'd be willing to hazard a guess that he did.  

Anyway, even though Marie upped the offer to match my current pay rate (so much for take it or leave it) and promised that I'd be reporting to her given my past history with Jim, I still declined as my new job had a lot more long term opportunity.  I ended up taking the job at the telco, just long enough to work out my notice period. HR was *VERY* confused at my exit interview when they noticed that I'd been with the company for only 9 working days. 

Incidentally, I ended up staying at CoolTechCompany for over 8 years. It was the best career move I ever made. My only regret about it was that I was never able to get Lynne a job there.  On the other hand, Marie stepped in and took away all of Jim's supervisory responsibility over the sysadmins, sticking him in a strict technical role.  He lasted a few months after that and bailed out to a much smaller company. "
talesfromtechsupport,"I witnessed this astounding IT meltdown around 2004 in a large academic organization.

An employee decided to send a broad solicitation about her need for a local apartment. She happened to discover and use an all-employees@org.edu type of email address that included everyone. And by ""everyone,"" I mean every employee in a 30,000-employee academic institution. Everyone from the CEO on down received this lady's apartment inquiry.

Of course, this kicked off the usual round of ""why am I getting this"" and ""take me offa list"" and ""omg everyone stop replying"" responses... each reply-all'ed to all-employees@org.edu, so 30,000 new messages. Email started to bog down as a half-million messages apparated into mailboxes.

IT Fail #1: Not necessarily making an all-employees@org.edu email address - that's quite reasonable - but granting unrestricted access to it (rather than configuring the mail server to check the sender and generate one ""not the CEO = not authorized"" reply).

That wasn't the real problem. That incident might've simmered down after people stopped responding.

In a 30k organization, lots of people go on vacay, and some of them (let's say 20) remembered to set their email to auto-respond about their absence. And the auto-responders responded to the same recipients - including all-employees@org.edu. So, every ""I don't care about your apartment"" message didn't just generate 30,000 copies of itself... it also generated 30,000 * 20 = 600,000 new messages. Even the avalanche of apartment messages became drowned out by the volume of ""I'll be gone 'til November"" auto-replies.

That also wasn't the real problem, which, again, might have died down all by itself.

The REAL problem was that the mail servers were quite diligent. The auto-responders didn't just send one ""I'm away"" message: they sent an ""I'm away"" message in response to *every* incoming message... including the ""I'm away"" messages of the other auto-responders.

The auto-response avalanche converted the entire mail system into an Agent-Smith-like replication factory of away messages, as auto-responders incessantly informed not just every employee, but also *each other*, about employee status.

The email systems melted down. Everything went offline. A 30k-wide enterprise suddenly had no email, for about 24 hours.

That's not the end of the story.

The IT staff busied themselves with mucking out the mailboxes from these millions of messages and deactivating the auto-responders. They brought the email system back online, and their first order of business was to send out an email explaining the cause of the problem, etc. And they addressed the notification email to all-employees@org.edu.

IT Fail #2: Before they sent their email message, they had disabled most of the auto-responders - but they missed at least one.

More specifically: they missed at least *two*.

talesfromtechsupport,"First post in quite some time! I work at a local authority on the helldesk. Social workers are the bane of my existence but you learn to cope with their general incompetence as part of the job. But sometimes they can still surprise you. This happened today.

So, we use a generic username for most of our computers so that people can log onto the machine, then from there they log into Citrix to work. Everyone knows the username and password for this. It's literally written on the walls in most areas, because the only thing it can access is another login page, so it isn't a security issue. Most of these accounts stay logged on at all times to save confusing the geniuses that work here. A guy rang up, said hello and asked for the generic login details. I've changed the exact username and password but other than that this is more or less word for word:


>**Genius**: So what's the username?  

>**Me**: It's 'Computer'.  

>**Genius**: so is that the asset number of the PC?  

>**Me**: Nono, it's just the word 'Computer'  

>**Genius**: And then backslash my name?  

>**Me**: NO. It's the word 'Computer.' C-O-M-P-U-T-E-R. Computer. nothing else.  

>**Genius**: And what's the password?  

>**Me**: It's 'P4ssword'. As in, the word 'Password' with a capital 'P', but you replace the 'a' with a '4'.  

>**Genius**: So it's 'Password4'?  

>**Me**: NO. It is not. It is 'P-4-s-s-w-o-r-d' With a capital P at the beginning. Everything else is lower case.  

>**Genius**: Ok, so the username is ComputerP4ssword. What's the password?  

>**Me**: NO. The username is Computer. The password is 'P4ssword'. That's everything. Just two words. Two boxes, two words.  

>**Genius**: *type type type* It didn't work. I typed in 'password' but it said it's incorrect.  

>**Me**: Spell out what you typed for me please.  

>**Genius**: 'p-a-s-s-w-o-r-d'  

>**Me**: *very slowly and clearly, in case it was my accent or something* ... Like i said. CAPITAL P. NUMBER FOUR. LOWER CASE S, LOWER CASE S, LOWER CASE W, LOWERCASE O, LOWERCASE R, LOWER CASE D. P4ssword.  

>**Genius**: *type type click* Nope. And it says the account is locked. I used a capital P this time definitely.  

>**Me**: did you use a 4 instead of the a?  

>**Genius**: Use four whats?  



I remoted to the machine and typed it in for him. He complained that the system was needlessly complicated."
talesfromtechsupport,"Every office has their special users.  The ones who can't figure out anything technical, everything is an emergency, and everything has to function exactly the same or they can't work.  At my job, it is the HR lady.  Since she is just HR, all her problems boil down to a printer error, excel, word, reboot and it works type of issues, and since I am the System admin they are all my responsibility.  

However, every issue she has she comes back to IT, walks right by my desk goes to the programmer, manager, network admin and explains the issue.  Every time they either tell her to go me (even though she gets bitchy), or relay the info to me to fix.  

A few weeks back, she had a problem with the calculations on an excel spreadsheet.  Everyone was at lunch, so she's forced to ask me.  Immediately, I say it is probably rounding up or down because it is only off by a penny.  This doesn't suffice, so she ignores me and waits until lunches are done to return.  She goes to programmer guy and like usual, he passes it to me.  I email her with a breakdown showing how it is rounding.  She still wants programmer guy to look at it, so my manager responds with a message saying he will get to when he can.

Well, programmer guy is swamped, the new website launch is getting pushed out, her excel ""problem"" gets shelved with her emails coming ever more frequent.  My manager even resends my explanation, but she wants programmer guy to look at it.  This is unacceptable, so she goes to the VP saying we aren't helping her.  

My boss sets up a meeting with the 3 of us for me to explain the issue.  It was the shortest meeting ever because I start explaining it and our VP completely understands right away.  The VP cuts me off, looks at HR lady and says ""You pulled me into a meeting for this shit?""

TLDR; HR lady with easy issue ignores obviously solution only to be burned by VP.

talesfromtechsupport,"Last year, Help Desk got a call from a user complaining that the laptop we issued him would not read DVDs.  He was one of those ""I'm a very busy and a very important man, and I don't have time to follow your troubleshooting steps over the phone.  Just fix it, dammit."" kinda guys, so he said he would get someone to drop off the laptop at our office and pick up a loaner.

&nbsp;

We received the laptop a couple days later, there was a note attached saying that now it wasn't even booting into Windows anymore.  Sure enough, he was right - it didn't even attempt to load Windows, and instead we were greeted by the ""Non-system disk or disk error"" message.  It sounded and looked like the PC was trying to boot from the DVD drive instead of the HDD.

&nbsp;

We opened the disk tray, and saw the culprit.  There was a DVD in there, all right - but it was placed upside down.

&nbsp;

We flipped the disc over. 

&nbsp;

He was trying to watch ""Dumb and Dumber""."
talesfromtechsupport,"So a few years back, I was working in a manufacturing company as IT manager. Like many industries, we had a number of machines with embedded computer systems. For the sake of convenience, we called these ""production machines"", because they produce stuff. By and large, these PC's are just normal desktop PC's that have a bunch of data acquisition cards in them connected to a PLC, or a second network card connected to an ethernet capable PLC. Invariably these PC's are purchased and configured when this production machine is being commissioned, and then just left as is until the production machine is retired... In some cases, this can be as long as 20 years. Please bear in mind that this is 20 years inside a dusty, hot factory environment.


I've been in manufacturing environments before, and this concept is not new to me. Thanks to a number of poignant lessons in the past, I make it my business to understand these PC's inside and out. I like to keep them on a tight refresh cycle, or when it's not practical (in the case of archaic hardware or software), keep as many spares as possible. Also, regular backups are important - you just have to understand that unlike a normal PC, it can be difficult to do and plan it well in advance. More often than not, these PC's aren't IT's responsibility - they fall under engineering or facilities. Even so, these guys understand that IT runs just about every other PC in the business, and welcome any advice or assistance that IT can provide. Finally, these PC's are usually tightly integrated into a production machine, and failure of the PC means the machine stops.


And so we have today's stars:

Airzone: Me, the new IT manager. 

TooExpensive: The site's facilities manager. He's in charge of the maintenance of the site, including all of these production machines. He's super paranoid about people trying to take his job, so he guards all his responsibilities jealously and doesn't communicate anything lest they get the drop on his efforts. Oh, and he has a fixation about not spending company money - even to the point of shafting the lawn-mowing guy out of a few hours pay - hence the name.

VPO: Vice president of operations. The factory boss. No nonsense sort of guy.

OldBoy: We'll get to him, but his name is derived from being a man in his 70's.


I'm new, but in my first few weeks I've already had a number of run-ins with TooExpensive. I'm a fairly relaxed guy, but I have no qualms about letting someone dig their own grave and fall into it - and in the case of TooExpensive, I'd be happy to lend him my shovel. My pet hate was when organising new network drops, I will always run a double when we needed a single. We're paying working-at-heights money already, and a double drop is material cost only. i.e. Adding $50 - $100 material on a $4000 single drop cost. He'd invariably countermand all my orders and insist on singles. And then a few weeks / months later, I'd have the sparkie in again to install the second drop, at another $4k.

And then there was the time that he was getting shirty because I was holding up a project of his.. Well sorry, if you are running a project that requires 12 - 16 network ports, you'd better at least talk to the IT guys prior to the day of installation. Not only will you not have drops, you won't have switch ports. And if you didn't budget for them, or advise far enough in advance that I could, then you can wait until I get around to it. Failure to plan is not an emergency.

So you could see that we didn't exactly gel together well.

Which brings us to these production machines, and the PC's nested within. Every attempt for me to try and document, or even understand  them was shut down by TooExpensive. 

> *Me*: Hardware and software specifications? 

> *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost. 

> *Me*: Startup and shutdown procedures? 

> *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost. 

> *Me*: Backup? 

> *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost.

> *Me*: Emergency contacts? 

> *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost.


You get the picture. It resulted in a strong and terse email from TooExpensive to leave it alone. He had all the documentation, contacts, backups, and didn't need, or want my meddling, and I was not to touch any production machine's PC under any circumstance.

Move forward a few months and I'm helping one of the factory workers on their area's shared PC. It's located right next to one of these production machines. It's old. The machine itself was nearly an antique, but the controls system had been ""recently"" upgraded. It had co-ax network of 2 PC's - one NT4 primary domain controller, and a NT4 workstation, and a network PLC (also on co-ax). The machines were pentiums running the minimum specs for NT4 to run, with a control application whose application logic was configured entirely through a propriety database. I had actually seen this software in a different company, so I had some basic familiarity with it. The co-ax was terminated on a hub with a few cat5 ports on it to connect to our LAN and an old hp laserjet printer. These particular production machines are rare, only a few of them exist in the world. We bought this one from a company that had gone out of business a few years earlier.

It was test&tag day and TooExpensive was running around a sparkie to do the testing. My earlier instruction to the sparkie was to not disconnect any computer equipment if it was not powered off. And so it came time to test this production machine's PC. The sparkie wasn't going to touch it while it was on. Luckily TooExpensive came prepared with his thoroughly documented shutdown procedure: yank the power cords. The test passed, new labels were applied to the power cord, he plugged it back in and turned it back on, then ran off to his next conquest without waiting for the boot to finish.

10 minutes later, the machine operator starts grumbling. I have a quick peek, and see that the control software had started, but the screen was garbled and none of the right measurements were showing. TooExpensive is called over, and he talked one look, pales, and then runs off. 

10 minutes later, the operator looks at me and asks for help. I call TooExpensive's mobile, and it's off. I called VPO's mobile and suggest that he comes over immediately.

10 minutes later, the operator, VPO, and I are looking at this machine. It's fucked. There's the better part of a million dollars worth of product to be processed by this machine, and the nearest alternate machine is in Singapore, belonging to a different company. And if the processing isn't done within soon, the product will expire and be scrapped. 40% of revenue is from product processed by this machine. We're fucked.

10 minutes later, we still can't get onto TooExpensive. We can't talk to him about the ""backups"" or any emergency contacts that he knows about. We can't even get his phone to ring.

So as I have said, I have used this software before and have a basic understanding. I know enough that the configuration is everything, and configuration is matched to the machine. But I also knew a guy who did some of the implementations. A call to him gave me a lead, and I followed the leads until about 4 calls later, I had the guy who implemented this particular machine. OldBoy had retired 10 years earlier, but VPO had persuaded him to come out of retirement for an eyewatering sum of money.

A few hours later, OldBoy took one look at the machine and confirmed that the database was fucked. We'd need to restore it from backup. TooExpensive is still not contactable.

> *Me*: Let's assume for a moment that there is no backup. What do we need to do.

> *OldBoy*: Normally I'd say pray, buy you must have done that already because I haven't kicked the bucket yet.

To cut a long story short, we had to rebuild the database. But not from scratch. OldBoy's MO was when setting up a machine, when he was done, he'd create and store a backup database on the machine. The only issue was that 20 years of machine updates needed to be worked out. It also just so happens that through sheer effort, I am able to compare a corrupted database file to a good one, and fool with it enough to get it to load in the configuration editor. It's still mangled, but we are able to use that as a reference to build the lost config. 

All up, it took 4 days to bring this machine back online. But we did. To be honest, I certainly wasn't capable of doing this solo, and without my efforts to patch the corrupted database file, OldBoy would not have been able to restore 20 years of patches that we had no documentation for.

And what of TooExpensive?

After OldBoy and I started working on the problem, he showed up again. He ignored any advice about a backup (because obviously there wasn't any), and instead demanded regular status updates for him to report to VPO. The little shit had screwed up the machine, run off to hide, and now a solution was in progress, was trying to claim the credit.

When it was all running again, OldBoy debriefed VPO on the solution. I then had my turn with VPO.

> *VPO*: So Airzone. Thanks for your help. Your efforts have un-fucked us. 

> *Me*: No worries.

> *VPO*: And now we get to the unpleasant bit. TooExpensive claims that you didn't follow procedure when shutting down the machine, causing it to crash. He also claims that you hadn't taken any backups, and it was effectively your fault.

> *Me*: And when we tried to call him?

> *VPO*: He claims he was busy contacting his emergency contacts.

> *Me*: I see.

> *VPO*: I don't believe a word of that shit. Unfortunately it's your word vs his. If I had the evidence, I'd fire him.

> *Me*: *(opening the email TooExpensive had sent me about meddling on my phone)* You mean this evidence?


Half an hour later, I got the call to lock TooExpensive's account and disabled his access card.


Edit: Wow, this story seems to have resonated with so many people here..  And thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"

EA = Extremely affluent sounding British guy

**Me:** Service desk how can I help?

**EA:** Oh hello I'm not able to print

**Me:** Okay, any error messages? Any signs of life from the printer?

**EA:** Now hold on I'm not a computer person so you'll need to use simple terms

**Me:** What happens when you print?

**EA:** Nothing happens that's why I'm calling you!

**Me:** Do you see any messages appear on the screen when trying to print?

**EA:** No

*I have a particularly low tolerance for these kinds of callers who are unable to provide even basic details. This guy was also coming across as very condescending*

**Me:** Is your printer turned on? Can you see any lights?

**EA:** Of course!

**Me:** Can you walk me through what you generally do to print something?

**EA:** I'm not a computer person so you'll need to be more clear

**Me:** Tell me how you'd usually print

**EA:** Look here, I don't really understand what you're asking me

**Me:** What would you usually do to print?

**EA:** I don't understand you

**Me:** Ok sir, I'd like to connect remotely to your computer so I can see what's on the screen. Is that okay?

**EA:** This is all very complicated. I'm not sure what you want to do.

**Me:** I'd like to access your computer so I can see what's wrong

**EA:** I'm sorry, can you explain that more clearly?

**Me:** I'm not sure how much clearer I can actually be with this. I need to remotely connect to try and fix this for you

**EA:** Look this is terribly unfriendly for people who aren't technically savvy like myself. Why can't you fix this?

**Me:** I'm trying to help you and fix it but you haven't been able to provide a great amount of detail on the issue, so I'd like to remotely connect a take a look myself

**EA:** I'm not familiar with these technical terms. This is very hard. I don't understand why we have you people if you can't help people who aren't technically savvy

**Me:** I'm trying to help, however as it's out of hours our scope is limited. I need to remotely connect to see what's going on. I respect that you are not technically savvy but at the same time we do expect a certain level of existing knowledge from users in order to be able to provide our support service after hours. I can ask that the main service desk calls you back in the morning if you'd prefer? 

**EA:** No look this is very important and I need this fixed, how do you get on my screen?

**Me:** Firstly, I need you to open a web browser or just go to Google

**EA:** I JUST USE THIS FOR EMAIL WHAT ON EARTH IS A WEB BROWSER?

**Me:** Do you use Google?

**EA:** Yes of course I do!

**Me:** Okay, please go to Google....

*we spend a painful amount of time getting gotoassist working*

**Me:** Thank you I'm now connected. I'm going to take a look at the printer setup now

**Me:** I see the printer is reporting ""not connected"". Can you check to make sure it's plugged in please?

*I Google the model number and this is an old-ass Epson printer. USB only. At this point I've had enough of this callers ineptness*

**EA:** But I don't know HOW!

**Me:** I'm sorry, I really can't help you with this part. You're the one physically located with the computer and the printer. Go to the printer and make sure any wires coming from it are plugged into the PC.

**EA:** OK. 

*Several minutes later I hear the unmistakable sound of a device being connected in Windows*

**Me:** Okay, the printer is now showing as connected so it looks like the plug was disconnected. Please try printing again.

*EA navigates to Outlook, opens an email about discounted camping products and proceeds to print it off*

**Me:** I can hear the printer in the background so it looks like we're good now?

**EA:** Yes it's working but you didn't help me at all *click*

EA was such a PITA. He also left gotoassist running in the background - so I spent the next half an hour inconspicuously moving his mouse each time he tried to click something before I got bored and disconnected.

talesfromtechsupport,"Hi all, mandatory LTL, FTP. On mobile so formatting will be a bit sketchy and disclaimer, not in Tech Support but hopefully will be eventually after completing my Comp-Sci degree.

Was in a TeamViewer session with a colleague but 10 brief minutes ago when I discovered to my distaste that his 2TB HDD was filled to the brim as was his 120GB SSD. Upon inquiring what was using such immense portions of precious digital real-estate, I was met with the standard ""I'm not sure, it's always been like that. I just delete stuff when it's too full to function."" Type response...

Enter WinDirStat to save the day. For those of you unaware, this little app displays the contents of your drives in a graphical layout, with the size usage of each file proportionately scaled to the others.

Normally one can expect a large block of medium sized files, some downloaded videos, a few steam games, but never in my years have I opened the application to find one GIANT M**********ING MONSTROSITY of a block consuming well over half the poor 2TB drive, barely leaving other little files to squeeze in around the edges, clawing desperately for some left over 1's and 0's to call home.

The seasoned among you will already have guessed, but this file was none other than the villain of the piece, the dark and shady 'pagefile.sys'. Our hero (yours truly) swam through the dark recesses of the system configuration in search of the settings pane that would confirm my hunch, all the while my colleagues eyes growing wider with understanding and guilt. Eventually I found it. The page file options were set to 'Manual Configuration', and that manual configuration was a default size of 1TB, with permission to expand to 1.2...

My colleague offered an explanation for his actions. Apparently some four years ago he fancied himself a game of Modern Warefare and was displeased to find it kept crashing. Rather than just quit some background applications or buy some more memory, he decided the best solution was to boost his page file size. First a GB, no good. Maybe 2GB. No dice. Eventually he must have just opted for 1 followed by a random amount of zeros, happening to be an entire TB.

Years passed and he didn't notice the change day to day as the page file gradually grew fatter, gorging itself on any scraps of excecutable it could find. Slowly expanding to occupy 1.2TB of his total 1.8. and that... Is how he has lived... Without question... For 4 years.

A page file size drop and reboot later and he was a happy camper, and I had my first TFTS post.

TL;DR: Friend wanted to play a game, lacked sufficient RAM. Sacrificed most of 2TB HDD to the page file gods as an eternal offering.

EDIT: Wow, this blew up overnight, thanks for making it a good first post all! :) Also, I've seen a lot of people ask why I'm doing Comp-Sci for tech support/wanting to go into tech support in the first place. Truth is I oversimplified things, I didn't think it was relevant but the specifics are, I'm doing a bachelor of Information Science, with a double major in Computer Science and Information Technology. Because, honestly I don't know specifically what I plan to do after graduating, just that I love IT and want to do something in that field. As for why tech support... After reading this sub-reddit, it sounds like it should keep me entertained!"

We brought on a new company 6 months or so ago, and along with it, came a sales  rep we'll call Virginia.

Virginia is 75 years old, ""not good with computers"", but has the best sense of humor and understanding I've ever had from a client. Every time she calls in she's always got something to say, which usually ends in a ""I hope you've got your Vallium nearby!"", And considers us all Wizards.

We recently updated our software, and sent an email out notifying users of this. She calls in yesterday, and we chat it up while I explain to her that yes, this was a real email, not spam, and that she should in fact update her program.

She says ""Ok, I'm going to try to be a big girl and update this myself, but stay by the phone!""

A few minutes go by, and the phone rings, sure enough, it's her on the Caller ID, so I pick up without using the standard greeting, and say ""Hey, Virginia!""

She responds, ""Darn, how did you recognize me with my hat and fake mustache on!?""

I lost it for a bit. Having a long week full of incompetent, ignorant, or intentionally destructive users was washed away because this little old lady told the most Dad-like joke over the phone.

TL;DR - Not all old users are bad, especially if they can laugh at themselves."
talesfromtechsupport,"Have a few spare laptops around the house from tech donation when I left my old job (my director said ""they'll just sit around otherwise, at least you'll use them."")

Battery's shot on one of them, but it's obviously fine when plugged in. My wife is using one of them right now, so I walked over to check model numbers to look for a replacement battery on Ebay. She asks what I'm doing, and I let her know. She asks why I think the battery's shot. I point to the orange flashing ""NOT CHARGING"" indicator.

> ""No, hon, it is charging. Look."" 

Unplugs laptop. Aaaaaand whatever she was doing is gone now, since the battery's not charging. She looked at me and said: 

> ""Okay, maybe not."""
talesfromtechsupport,"We have a pretty simple system. You ask for **something** and you get **something**. With me so far? It really is that simple for the user. We have to do some crazy routing on our end depending on what **something** is but that is an entirely different story. 

There is also a big button that say click here if you want **something** for someone else. With a giant red warning underneath that says ""Hey if you don't use that big button right above the **something** you ask for will be FOR YOU"". 

We even have a ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T MEAN YOU WANT IT FOR SOMEONE ELSE?  YOU ALREADY HAVE **SOMETHING** if the system detects you already have **something**. 

So enter *user A*. This user supports many other users. The department might get a lot of turn over because every month they get at least 1 new person. Or maybe they're expanding? Who knows not my problem. 

Like clock work the 2nd Monday of every month we get a ticket. ""I asked for **something** for new hire but they never got it. Please fix."" I'm not kidding. Literally every 2nd Monday of every month for the last year or so. Can you guess what went wrong? Let me give you a hint...it has something to do with someone not using the giant button and not reading the 2 different warnings or popups. 

I had gotten really tired of sending *user A* the same email every month...""Please use the button to ask for **something** for someone else. We'll send ticket over to finance to swap the charges"". That email also contains very detailed step by step instructions. The rest of my team had also gotten tired of hearing from *user A* so we decided to not help this time(with manager/director backup). 

We disabled the ability for *user A* to submit tickets. They must call the help desk for tickets now. We also didn't forward the current ticket to finance. We sent *user A* a strongly worded email that basically said ""Look you do this EVERY month. We told you HOW to do this the correct way for a year. If you still can't figure it out you're on your own and all these charges will fall on you."" Attach the last 12 month's worth of tickets. CC *user A*'s boss. 

*User A* must have not noticed her boss CCed on the email because we get a nasty email back. ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T OPEN TICKETS ANYMORE?! AND WHY AM I GETTING CHARGED FOR IT?! DO YOU KNOW WHO I SUPPORT?! YOU WILL FIX THIS NOW OR MY BOSS WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS."" Insert other comments about how stupid the system is and how incompetent my team is and other non professional language. Email was also largely in caps. 

We didn't get around to responding until after lunch but as it turns out we don't need to respond anymore. 

*User A*'s boss has apparently responded. ""I apologize for the behavior of *user A*. Please don't let her behavior affect the wonderful support you provide to our department. *User B* will now be responsible for interfacing with your team to get **something** for our new hires. Please grant *User B* the permissions *user A* previously had.  I've read through your directions you send *user A* over and tried it out. It worked as expected. *User B* will be using those directions to complete her work. Also please see *ticket #* for terminating *user A*'s network access. 

We killed *user A*'s network account with pleasure. "
talesfromtechsupport,"A call comes in, a user reports her keyboard is going erratic, it is ""possessed."" I take a stroll down to the office bearing a new replacement keyboard. 

I get there and I begin to make sure that it is indeed a faulty keyboard, and not just some gunk sticking the key down. I open up notepad and immediately I am barraged by ""...nnnnnnn..."" Everything seems fine otherwise, this keyboard is the same model as the replacement I brought over, so relatively new, no sticky keys either. Very well a faulty keyboard it is. Until...

...Until I move the tower and notice a second, wireless keyboard sitting on the side of it, laying flat on the floor, with a stack of papers and a tissue box sitting atop. I pull it out and notice the n barrage has stopped on the screen. I press the N key once again and an n is added to the word file. 

Exorcism was performed, demons were banished, am now priest. "
talesfromtechsupport," I was working for a large warehouse and customization company under contract through another company and recently they had been talking about cutting people and shifts to make up for the lack of sales during the summer and wanted us to show our worth. 

 The IT manger asked me since I was the last hire to show my worth and why I should not be cut. 80% of what I had to do in the first 3 months I had gotten down to simple scripted fixes by talking to the software vendors and learning the fixes. Plus reduced turn around time on broken RF guns by actually looking at how to repair them and which of the parts from the old guns being replaced were compatible with the new models. 

 I presented all of this to him and the following week I was notified by my contract manager they were letting me go. Fine with that really as seasonal was coming up and the no drug test or background check hires were the worst each year. Two days later I get a call from the manager demanding the scripts I used. While at the job they never provided me with any tools and they told us to use our own if we needed it. I had never put the scripts on the server or on my work computer. I check my contracts for any clause for files or documents I create while on the job and then proceeded to tell him they were not worth me keeping my job, so I deleted them when requested to dormat my drive upon termination, but they could keep my screwdriver set in my drawer so they can have one in the office.

For those who cant keep up.
Scripts were made on my own time off the clock talking to software vendors cause they are closed during  my night shift. Never left my USB drive. Was deleted per request for my drive being formatted on termination. I was a contractor and the scripts would belong to my contract company and not the company I was sent to if any and they already said they dont want them I am safe. (They dont make money if I am not there)"
talesfromtechsupport,"So, I had to walk a client through setting up a printer over the phone. Which required her to set an IP address to the printer. Also she is not tech smart at all. 

Me: ""Ok, do you have a usb cable? Sometimes they come with the printer""

Her: ""No, im looking in the box now. Theres no usb cable. Only the printer and power""

*So it needs to me networked, great. I walk her through getting the printer on her network*

Me: ""Ok, do you see a place to enter 4 numbers?""

Her: ""Yep, its right here""

Me: ""Ok the number is 192.168.0.3""

Her: ""Ok, I put in 19216803. Whats the 2nd number?""

Me: ""No, lets start over. The first number is 192, second is 168, third is 0, and fourth is 3""

Her: ""Ok, so 192.168.03?""

Me: ""No, the third number is just 0, the fourth is 3""

Her: ""So, 0.0.0.3?""

Me: ""no, 192.168.0.3""

Her: ""But what about the 0?""

Me: ""What about it?""

Her: ""Shouldn't it be a number?""

Me: ""0 is a number""

Her: ""Look this it to complex for me, cant we just use the cable it came with?""

Me in my head: WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME YOU HAD A CABLE!?!??! YOU SAID YOU JUST HAD THE PRINTER AND POWER CABLE!

Me: "".....yes""

Edit: I should say, this is the shortened version. IRL this conversation went on for 30 min and this ticket lasted 2 days. 

Edit2: I said ""Zero"", NOT ""o"" and I said both ""period"" and ""dot"""
talesfromtechsupport,"This is my all-time favorite interaction with tech support.

Late one December evening a number of years ago, I got an unexpected call from my boss.  He said there was a fire at the office, and I might want to come in and see what was going on.

So I did.  By the time I got there, the fire was on its way out, and I and a couple dozen others were standing around in the parking lot waiting for the firefighters to give us the all-clear to enter the building.

We had Internet service through an awesome local ISP at the time.  The kind of small company that really cared about service.

While I was shivering next to a fire truck, my cell phone rang.  It was one of their techs, whom I had shared on office with at a different company years ago and knew well.

> Me: Hello?

> Tech: Hi, this is $TECH from $ISP.  Just wanted to let you know that our monitoring noticed your Internet link is down, and we're working on it.

> Me: That might be because it's on fire.

Long pause.  Then:

> Tech: Did you just say it's on fire?

> Me: Yeah, there was a fire in the building.  I'm standing next to a fire truck right now.  They aren't letting us in yet.

Then, without missing a beat, $TECH said something he *never* said at that ISP (remember, premium service):

> Tech: Ah, well OK then.  I'll assume the problem is on your end.  *click*

Despite the cold and the uncertainty (how badly damaged was the office, etc), I couldn't help laughing at the absurdity of it all.

----

Because $ISP was awesome, less than 5 minutes later he called back to say, ""I just checked, and we have two portable generators that aren't in use right now.  If you need them, just say the word, and I can have them there in 2 hours, any time, day or night.  No charge.""  Our contract with them had nothing in it about generators."
talesfromtechsupport,"It work for a small IT company providing website, email servers and web software.  

**the interlocutors :**  
> $Me : Your dearest  
> $Boss : Boss of client company  
> $Mom : Co-Boss of client company and also $Boss's Mother  

After few year of collaboration with $Client our accountant come to me saying that $Client haven't pay the monthly fee for their website and mail server.  
*Sometime clients forget to set up automatic transfer when they change bank or their accountant went on vacation and forgot to tell someone to do it*  
So i call then to know what append :  

> $Me: Hi, it's $Me from $IT we havent received your transfer from last month. Is there a problem ?  
> $Mom: I don't know what are those fee. I won't pay for it.  
> $Me: These fees are for your website and your mail server.  
> $Mom: We don't use it. I don't want it. I won't pay for it *Click*  

*Okay! You do not have to be this rude.*  
So we send a registered letter with recorded delivery saying that if they do not pay until the end of next month we will have to shut down all their service.  

After a month and a little bit, still no transfer, we shut off everything.  
Sure thing 30 minutes later we receive a call from $Boss.  

> $Boss: My emails stopped working you have to fix this please.  
> $Me: Yes we shut of your server because you haven't paid your monthly fees for the last two months.  
> $Boss: What ? But $Mom is in charge off all the suppliers, she should have paid you.  
> $Me: No, she told us that you did not need our services and did not want to pay for it.  
> $Boss: She is crazy! We take care of all our invoices and contracts by emails. Without them we may as well close the company. I will take care of paying you personally from now on. But please start the server back on.  

So we did and 20 min later one of his employee was at our door with a check for last two month and the upcoming one. And from this point he always paid us in time.  
"
talesfromtechsupport,"Sometimes, people pry apart my spreadsheets and tools and code for various reasons. And when they do, they find a hidden bit of code. I put it everywhere, as a sort of signature. People wonder what it is and they ask me. And I get to tell them this story.

~

I was a tier I remote support tech. This was one of my first officially IT jobs, and I was a young, fresh-faced, wide-eyed kid with a working knowledge of some kind of code and the ability to install Java with over a 50% success rate.

*ring ring* went the phone. I perked up. Another customer desperately in need, on the brink of disaster, had called upon me to single-handedly resolve their problem and leave them 110% satisfied. A problem I alone had the keys to fix (so long as it was within the exceptionally narrow purview of the types of problems I was trained to handle)!

""Thanks for calling Tech Support Megacorp! My name is Clickity, can I have your name and client number, please?""

There was a long pause and then the person slowly gave me their info. I plugged it into my system and BAM. I looked at the client's info: they were based out in Washington State. A very remote office, easily three or four hours' drive from their nearest deskside support analyst. If I couldn't fix their issue, they might not be up and running for days.

*I was their last hope.*

""So our computer's been running really slow,"" he guy starts out, and I jump on it.

""I see! Let me see if you have any hanging processes going on? Do you know what version of java you're running? Have you recently uninstalled or reinstalled any programs?""

No to all of these. our remote session was lagging for sure. But I couldn't find out what was the cause. 

""See it started after this storm..."" the guy went onto a ramble about the weather and how they've been dealing with landslides and other unrelated things. meanwhile, I keps scrounging for data in the system. The processor was just running so slow.

""...and it's been hot and the computer smells pretty funny.""

I slopped. ""Smells funny? have you...um..have you cleaned it recently to get dust out of it?"" I felt like a Genie-oos. Once he vacuumed that up he'd be all good to go.

There was a long pause while the guy presumably took the case off the PC. then-- ""Agh! Oh god! aaaaaahgh!"" *Slam. Slam.* ""Over there!"" Strings of profanity. Then quiet.

""Sir?"" I asked after a moment. ""Are you still there? is everything ok?""

""No!"" he shouts. ""there's a hole in the wall, and it looks like they got in after the storm...some...god, they've built a *hive*."" 

""What?"" 

He repeated himself. ""So...yeah...can you like, get someone out here with a new PC or something? I know it's hard to get someone out here and all...""

Undeterred, I assured them I'd have someone out as soon as I could. I typed up the ticket and sent it on its way, and I never heard how it got resolved. But I will never forget that ticket as I sent it on its way:

>Computer completely filled with bees. Sending to deskside support.

~

I learned something important that day. Never take a problem at face value or assume you have all the pertinent info, no matter how usual it may seem. Listen when the customer gives you background info, some of it might be important. And never, ever, choose to work in deskside repair in the mountains.

And that is why, in every code or spreadsheet I've ever written, somewhere you will find the phrase ""Computer completely filled with bees"". To remind myself that no matter how much I feel like a Genie-oos, there's always room for being completely wrong and completely surprised.

**TL;DR**: Customer's PC had a bug I wasn't able to fix."

talesfromtechsupport,"Same company and website as previous tale here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5ltdyz/why_consistent_password_policies_are_important/

So there's this website used by a few thousand paying customers - something like $200/year. It's used by pastors to download material to use in their church services. We support the following browsers -keep in mind this is probably ~~2002/2003~~ 2006 (thanks /u/gargarlord and /u/BCdotWHAT):

* Internet Explorer for Windows

* Internet Explorer for Mac

If you've never heard of Internet Explorer for Mac, be grateful. Anyway, Chrome did not yet exist, and Firefox either didn't, or was super early on and not that great. Then something happened. Microsoft killed IE for Mac. I don't mean they just stopped developing it. They pulled the download links, and more or less pretended it didn't exist. If you didn't already have it, there was no way to get it - if there was some sort of abandonware website or other repository for old software back then, I didn't know about it and couldn't find it.

Our Mac browser support remained the same: IE only.

>$Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble with your website.

>$Me: What browser are you using?

>$Customer: Safari

>$Me, through gritted teeth: Unfortunately we don't support Safari. You'll need to use Internet Explorer.

>$Customer: Oh, how do I get that?

>$Me: You can't.

>$Customer: ...what?

>$Me: We only support Internet Explorer on Macs. If you have a Windows computer, you can use that. If not, you'll need to get Internet Explorer.

>$Customer: Ok...this is my only computer, so how do I get it?

>$Me: You can't. They no longer make it. It's not available anywhere.

>$Customer: So how do I use your website that I'm paying for?

>$Me: You can't.

>$Customer: Do you not see the problem here?

>$Me: Ok look, maybe we can help each other out here. We really should support Safari, but we don't. There's no other option. If possible, can you please write me an email, and be as upset as you can - swear, threaten to cancel, threaten to sue, whatever you can. I'll take it to the powers that be and try to get this fixed for you.

>$Customer: You want me to swear? I'm a pastor!

>$Me: I know. Look, it's Thursday afternoon. Getting this pushed through before Sunday isn't going to be easy.

>$Customer: I'm sure God will understand.

So I get this email from him, and it's everything I asked for - ranting and raving about how we're preventing him from doing God's work. Thankfully, he didn't complain about me at all. I take it to the web development team - same $Dev as in the previous story linked above.

>$Dev: So what's not working?

>$Me: [problem I can no longer remember]

>$Dev: I'm pretty sure it works. [Opens Safari and tests successfully.]

>$Me: Wait, we don't support Safari.

>$Dev, rolling eyes: I know. It works great, it's what I use all the time, faster than IE. But [$VP of something or other] won't approve the 30 minutes it'll take me to fix it for newer versions of Safari. I just don't upgrade mine so I can use it.

Thankfully, I had just helped $VP with a weird problem with his computer, and he was super grateful. I walked over to his office, and he happened to be free. It was about 3pm on a Thursday, and we closed at 4.
>$Me: Sorry to bug you, but...well, you should read this.
He reads the email, and his eyes go wide.

>$VP: This is from one of our customers?

>$Me: Yeah, he was trying to finish his sermon for Sunday and-

I didn't even finish my sentence before he was calling $Dev's manager. By 4:45, our website officially supported Safari and I was on the phone with $Customer to deliver the good news.

I'd like to think God understood.

>c: That's ridiculous. That's so much work. Why do you make it so hard? This should be simple. I want to speak to your manager.

>me: (eager to pass them off on someone else) No problem. My manager is cc'd. He would be happy to assist you.

>manager: How can I help?

>c: Your employee is rude, stupid, and not helpful. I just want to log in, I don't want to reset my password, I don't want to click on this virus she sent me, and this is taking forever and it is ridiculous. 

>manager: Sir, respectfully, we are going to need you to meet us halfway and change your password.

>client: (in all caps, this is via email) THIS IS BULLSHIT. I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD. YOU ARE IDIOTS.

>manager: Again, we are sorry that this is frustrating for you. Please let us know what we can do to help. 

Manager cc's client's boss, the director of their org and the one whose signature is on the contract. My manager does not take shit from clients.

>client's boss (to their employee with us cc'd): Are you serious? These nice people are doing everything they can to help you, and you are abusing and belittling them. This is an embarrassment to our organization. You owe them both an apology, and you need to reset your password, stop complaining, and log in so you can get me that report that was supposed to be on my desk yesterday. The fact that you've wasted your entire day on this is ridiculous and this will definitely be included in your performance review.

My manager and I were in tears. Client's boss was savage af and did not pull a single punch. The client did end up resetting his password but did not apologize. Last time I sent out an email to clients, his bounced. His ass got fired. *evil cackle*

edit: woah, thanks for the gold! "
talesfromtechsupport,"I was working service desk, and it was getting towards the end of the day and we were winding down before leaving at 5 when I had a call from a very angry man, who ran a small business.

He'd logged a ticket the day before for being unable to print to a specific printer, however he could walk 20 more meters and collect his documents from another perfectly fine printer. The job had been with the senior engineers for the day as obviously, this is not the highest priority issue we'd had today. Despite being polite and offering to speak with the team leader he flips out. I DON'T WANT YOU TO SPEAK WITH A MANAGER, I WANT YOU TO ****ING FIX IT.

My boss is very good about us not taking abuse from customers, so I immediately flick him an I'M that it's starting to go south. I tell him I'm sorry I can't fix it, but I'll organise an engineer to give him a call tomorrow and speak with my team leader. He doesn't take this well and immediately yells ""I WANNA SPEAK WITH YOUR ****ING MANAGER""

I say of course and go to transfer the call, my boss picks up and I deadpan to him, I've got a gentleman who wants to speak with my ****ing manager. He gives me a grin and then says to put it through. He sits on the phone for 5 seconds before asking him to stop swearing, I didn't hear this part but evidently he doesn't stop. He immediately hangs up on the customer, speaks with the director and has all service for this customer cancelled. 

Manager then says you did absolutely the right thing and says if he ever calls back we're to put him straight through and never help him with anything."
talesfromtechsupport,"I used to work for a particularly large ISP doing tech support. One day the guy working next to me was dealing with a particularly rude business customer. The business customers were usually treated like kings but this guy was having a particularly hard time even getting a word in. Eventually he put up his hand to motion the supervisor come talk to the customer.

Right then the owner of the company happened to be walking by with another one of the execs. I've met the guy a few times at the company social events and he is a really down to earth employee friendly boss. He asked what the issue was with his customer and after it was explained he took the headset and picked up the line.

After listening for about 4-5 minutes he said very flatly ""That's never going to happen, especially not when you have an attitude like a 13 year old girl."" Again listening for a minutes before he said ""I don't have a manager. I own this company and I don't have to listen to this s..t from an a..hole like you and neither do my employees. I'm terminating your account with us.""

He hung up and I watched him disable this guys account and add a note to the file. ""Customer is an a..hole. Do not reinstate account - Boss"". Then he just handed back the headset and carried on about his day.

edit: since so many people have asked the issue the guy was going nuts about was something to do with a delay in testing for a fault on his line; something that is done by the phone company and not by the ISP. We literally have nothing to do with it other than submitting the request for testing to them. "
talesfromtechsupport,"In keeping with my tendency to share these stories immediately when I'm reminded of them, I must confess that I posted this once already as a comment in /r/gaming without even thinking of you guys. Sorry about that.

What follows is a story that comes from my first few months at [medium-sized company]. I previously posted here to tell [a story about the time I poisoned a user] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5gujya/you_poisoned_my_keyboard/), and [another story about that time I stealthily upgraded users to Windows 7 by moonlight (now with a working post)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ypxhl/windows_xp_and_old_pos_software_vs_my_boss/).

So anyway.

I was a tier 1 phone jockey and this was my first “adult job” after college, so you can imagine how surprised and nervous I was when one day I get an email with the subject line “FWD: DISABLE FACEBOOK NOW!!” 

It was written just like that- in all caps, two (or maybe three) exclamation points. Inside, there was a long message chain containing an extended rant from our marketing executive (MKT), sent to the CEO, replied to, forwarded to the CIO, replied to, forwarded to my manager, and then kicked down to me with no explanation.

My manager did this kind of thing a lot- rather than open a ticket in the ticketing system he insisted we use a certain way, or explain anything in his emails, he would simply forward us an email chain of a conversation he’d been having with some store or department manager, some executive, or some vender, and we’d have to read through all of it to figure out what he wanted. 

This email was one of those. And since it had come from people up the chain from him, I had to read through all of his pathetic groveling and deferential boot-licking to reach the part where he made his unqualified promises about what I’ll do in how much time. 

Eventually, I surmised the following:

-MKT is upset that his employees are spending work time on social media.

-He has decided that this is all IT’s fault.

-He wants social media ""disabled on ALL computers."" 

-He sent this complaint to the CEO, because it’s not good enough to contact IT and open a ticket to get something done, he has to try to get someone fired while he’s at it.

Okay, fine. We actually had Websense, so I wrote up a ticket, opened up the admin console in Websense, and added Facebook’s URL to the blacklist. Done and done. 

I reply-alled to the message chain and let the executives know that we’re good. Immediately I got hammered with replies from the CEO, my manager, and MKT (who had made the request). They all wanted to know why I disabled Facebook on *their* machines.

Exercising all the restraint I had, I apologized and explained that when they said “disable Facebook on ALL computers” I didn’t realize that they meant for there to be exceptions to the rule.

I grabbed one of our Tier-3 guys and he helped me set up MAC filtering in Websense. We made a group for the executives and managers to be excepted from the social media blackout, and then blocked twitter, instagram, and all the other common social media sites while we were at it.

Thinking the issue has now been properly dealt with, I updated the executives, who seem placated, updated the ticket, and then closed it.

15 minutes later, a red-faced young woman (SMM) appeared in the IT office. She’s from marketing and was upset because she couldn’t reach Facebook or Twitter. I gently explained that those had just been blocked at the request of her department’s exec.

SMM: “But you’re NOT supposed to block ME! I’m a social media manager! It’s MY JOB to be on FACEBOOK. NOW I CAN’T WORK!”

Me: “Oh. Hang on.”

I placed a quick speakerphone call to MKT and got his admin assistant (AA).

AA: “MKT’s office.”

Me: “Yeah, can I speak with MKT? It’s about the Facebook blackout he requested.”

AA: “Ooh yeah, he’s pretty upset about that.”

Of course.

Me: “Can I speak to him?”

After a minute, she got him on the line.

MKT: “Rathwood! Glad you finally got it right.”

Me: “Sir? SMM is in my office right now.”

MKT: “So? Tell her to get back to work.”

Me: “Sir, she can’t. She says it’s her job to run the company’s social media pages and she can’t work now because of the block. Do I have your permission to unblock her?”

MKT: “...”

Me: “...”

MKT: “You mean we’re paying someone to be on Facebook?”

Me: “...she works for your department, sir.”

MKT: “Unblock her for now, and tell her to come see me in my office.”

Me: ""Okay.""

Okay.

I turned to look at SMM, and she was already walking out.

ME: “Hey- are you alright?”

She turned back to me. 

SMM: “I’m fine. This is the third time this month that dinosaur has forgotten that I work here. I’m used to explaining my job to him.”"
talesfromtechsupport,"Greetings, all. This one is from way back when, about six years ago now, when I was in an entirely different career and halfway around the world. No salad dressing this time, and I'm sure you're all disappointed.

On a certain class of military warship, there is a place. The bridge may be in control of where the ship goes, but Damage Control Central is in charge of how fast it is getting there and whether or not it arrives in one piece. It's run by a high-ranking officer from Reactor Department (EW) and his two cronies, one that monitors the ship's water usage and one that monitors the ship's electrical usage (hi) These three people can bring 97K+ tons of steel and sadness to a halt. Behind them are a small pile of engineering folk, literally the ship's tech support branch. People could call DCC and report a problem (from an out light to a fire), and between all of us in there, we had the knowledge, skill, authority, and political clout to get a response team out. A lot of people didn't know what kind of authority DCC held, or exactly who they were talking to when they called down. This made for some very entertaining conversations.

One evening, the engineering folk get a call. One female sailor picks it up and naturally, we all listen in, because if it's a fire or something, we all need to respond as rapidly as possible. From our POV, this is how the conversation goes:

>Eng: DCC, Eng speaking.  
>Eng: The heater doesn't work?  
>Eng: Oh, yeah, that's normal.  
>Eng: No, we can't turn it up.  
>Eng: What? No, we can't replace it, we're in the middle of the Persian Gulf, where are we going to get another one?  
>Eng: Look, it works fine. Take shorter showers.  
>Eng: Your division can put in a request for a bigger one when we get back to home port, but you're not getting one now.  
>Eng: Yeah, no, I'm not ordering one. Replacing those things is beyond the scope of what we're allowed to do underway.  
>Eng: Because policy.  
>Eng: Okay. You do that. We'll be waiting. Make sure you request permission to enter.  

With that, she hangs up. Naturally, we're all staring. She grins at us.

>Eng: Game faces on, this one is gonna be good. Sir, I am sorry in advance.  
>EW: You kidding? This shit is what makes watch worth-while.  

We sit back and put on our best 'I hate everything' faces and wait.

Not fifteen minutes later, the door thuds open. In walks (with permission) the hero of this little story, a very low-ranking punk (LRP) who think's he's hot shit because he does maintenance on air planes instead of steam pipes. With him is his immediate supervisor (LPO) a gentleman of my rank, and their divisional officer (Divo) a wee young lieutenant. Divo is all fired up because how dare Engineering not fix his guy's problem, and he makes a bee-line for the engineering folk.

This path will, briefly, place him between EW and a panel that, by the order of people with a rank I could never hope to achieve in my life, the EW is not allowed to be obscured from. They HAVE to be able to see it, at all times. I wait until the merry little band is almost in front of the EW before I speak up.

>Me: Sir, please go around, the EW needs to be able to see that panel.  
>Divo: I will walk where I damn well-  

He stops. Because someone of approximately double his rank, four times his time-in-service and significantly crankier is staring him down. All of the fire leaves Divo in an instant. Which, honestly, is exactly what I wanted. When high-ranking people get fired up, it's usually for a good reason. When baby divos get fired up, everyone in their general vicinity is stupider for witnessing their temper tantrum. Baby divos get much more done when they're calm.

LPO realizes that a Commander is sitting there and nearly poops himself. LRP is completely oblivious.

They walk back around our desks, not nearly as grudgingly as they could have, and take the slightly longer route to the engineering folk. Who are having the time of their lives, because this shit circus is well underway and they haven't had to even do anything yet. Eng spins around, her hands on the arms of her chair, a very pleasant, blank smile on her face.

>Divo: Are you the one that won't fix my guy's showers?  
>Eng: The showers aren't broken, sir. Did he tell you what his complaint was?  

LPO nearly cringes out of his skin. Because, no, obviously what happened is that LRP went and bitched at LPO that 'those assholes in engineering said they won't fix the broken showers' and LPO immediately went to his office to find some back-up and grabbed Divo. By the way we're all grinning at him, LPO knows he is in for the ass-reaming of his life.

Divo, however, looks to LRP for an explanation. The little nematode puffs up, very pleased to have the floor, and an audience to boot. At least two Very Important Officers get to hear his sound reasoning for calling down to the tech line. I sit there wishing popcorn was allowed in DCC.

>LRP: Well, the hot water heater in the head can't keep up with the entire division when we all shower in the morning.  
>Eng: Does it put out hot water at all?  
>LRP: Well, yeah, when we all get up it works just fine. But as everyone takes their showers, it gets colder and colder.  
>Eng: Does it ever go completely cold?  
>LRP: No, but with a bigger heater, we could all take as long of showers as we wanted without it running out.  
>Water Control Guy: Showers should be limited to five minutes, you're wasting water.  
>LRP: Well, yeah, morning showers are pretty short, who wants to wake up early and shower? But when I take my second, longer shower in the evening, to relax after a long day of working-  

Some teeny tiny sense of self-preservation kicks in and LRP shuts up and looks around. He is in a room full of people who play the 'food, shower, sleep - pick 2' game on a daily basis. Every single person in this room, including his back-up, is staring at him with either full derision or outright hostility.

Except Eng. She's still smiling her blank, polite, 'I have been in the retail trenches and am dead inside' smile. I may be in love.

>Eng: Sir, you can see why I denied his request. LPO, you may want to remind your guys that, despite being surrounded with water, there is a limit on how much fresh water we can make in a day and that long showers should be saved for in port. Was there anything else I can help you all with?  
>Divo: No, I think I've heard enough. You two, my office. *Now.*  

They leave. LPO looks close to tears or shoving LRP out a porthole. Divo is full of now-justified wrath. LRP still looks vaguely bemused as to why his excellent argument didn't sway us all to his side.

The door shuts. All of us immediately put our heads on our desk and cry with laughter. Someone hands Eng an IOU for drinks at the next port. 

Eng's supervisor drafts an email to the ship's mid-tier leadership that not waking up early enough to get a hot shower is not a reason to request a new hot water heater and that water on board is limited. No details are provided and everyone eagerly looks forward to the rumor mill as people try and figure out what spawned *that* particular reminder.

The engines turn. The ship chugs on.

Edit: Thanks to /u/RobAtSGH for the gold!"
talesfromtechsupport,"This is the story about the most emotional call I've ever taken. I work at an ISP as a tier 2 representative for tech support. Essentially, one of the jobs I have is programming calling features.


This call in particular happened about a month ago. A ticket had came to my queue about a customer having trouble accessing her voicemails. I dug deeper and found it was full as well. No problem, there were some programming errors, which I fixed and called the customer who will be known as Sweet Elderly Woman. (SEW)


SEW: Hello?


Me: *intro, verification* So, I am calling because you reported an issue with your voicemail today.


SEW: Oh yes! Is it fixed?


Me: Yes! It should be. I found that your box is full. It has *maximum amount* of messages in it.


SEW: Dear, I'd hate to be a bother but could I get you to go in and delete them for me? (We have a way of accessing the messages if the customer cannot, doesn't want to, etc.) 


Me: Absolutely. I will gladly do this for you, SEW and I'll call you back when I'm finished?


SEW: Yes please!


She thanks me and I hang up to go access the messages. Knowing full well that this is going to take at least 15 minutes, I go and read Wikipedia articles as the messages are playing. I eventually reach the last message and it catches my attention. I stopped reading, listened to it, began tearing up and saved it in her box. I compose myself before calling back.


SEW: Hello?


Me: Hi! It's /u/devdevo1919 again. I listened to all the messages and deleted them all except for one.


SEW: Oh thank you, sweetheart! Why did you leave one?


Me: SEW, I think you should listen to it. I will hang up to give you some time, okay?


SEW: Okay, dear.


I gave her time to listen to the message and called her back. She was crying when I called her back. It was then I learned the story. The message was from her husband who had passed away due to brain cancer 3 days after he left the message. It was him saying goodbye and that he loves SEW so much and he's ""never felt more alive"" all the years she spent with him. 



SEW was crying because he was deceased by the time she got to the hospital and had not heard his voice. She said I gave her part of herself back that she'd lost when he passed away. She thanked me and we disconnected the call.


EDIT: To answer some of the comments I am seeing, no I do not have to listen to them but I explain crystal clear that the messages will start playing and I will hear who they're from. This person had the same last name as her which is why I listened to it and saved it.


EDIT 2; Wow! Gold?! Thank you so much!!"
talesfromtechsupport,"My mom is sweet, but she has this notion she shouldn't bother me unless its important. 

My phone rang last week while I was home. Day off.

> Mom: ""Do you have a minute honey? My internet doesn't work, either computer, nor the tablet either.. I was thinking maybe you could come have dinner later and look at it? I bought chicken, soft cheese, wine, and I'm baking a..""

Somewhere later down the menu I already fixed it. I work at the telco, and have access to my tools remotely, I saw it had no valid IP so I reset the modem and the router we provide her. Basic lease renewal issue. It happens, everything else is green.

> Bytewave: ""Boom, magic, you're online mom.""

> Mom: "" Whaa? ... Oh. You're right."" *Sounds disappointed.* ""Thank you, that was really fast, I guess I won't trouble you to come over then.""

... Clearly she was more excited at the prospect of the meal than the free tech support, but  for her it seems something broken or a holiday is required to 'trouble' me to hang out.

> Bytewave: "" Hey hey there, I was promised a home cooked meal here. I'm happy to come anyway.""

> Mom: ""Haa that's fine, its nice of you to be polite. But I know you're busy, you don't have to. We can do this another time.""

Okay let's do this the easy way. Reach back to the tools, deprovision the router.

> Bytewave: ""There, its broken again mom. And it'll stay that way till dessert.""

> Mom: ""Oh! Lovely then, shall we say 6 o'clock?"" *cheerful*

talesfromtechsupport,"Standard disclaimer, not IT, I just know how to google things.

I have a very good friend who is a doctor.  I sometimes ask him for tips on health related things, and he often comes to me for technical / mechanical advice.  It wasn't always this way, though.  Near the beginning of our friendship, an incident happened involving an iPhone 3GS (back when it first came out) that really helped pave the way for understanding between the two of us.

(Over the phone)  
>Doc:  ""Hey I'm having some problems with my iPhone, can you help?""  
>Me:  ""Sure, are you on it right now?""  
>Doc:  ""No, I'm calling from my landline.""  
>Me:  ""OK, great, what's the problem?""  
>Doc:  ""It's not working.""  
>Me:  ""....yes, go on.""  
>Doc:  ""I just said.  It's not working.""  
>Me:  ""Is it not turning on?  Is it not being responsive?""  
>Doc:  ""It's on, just not working.  I thought you knew iPhones?""  

At this point, I was starting to lose my patience.

>Me:  ""OK, imagine I called you up.  You can't see me, but you want to help me.  And all I'm willing to say is that it hurts.  But I refuse to tell you what hurts, where it hurts, how it hurts, and what I was doing before it started hurting.  All I'm telling you over the phone is that it hurts, and I'm getting impatient with YOU.  How would you feel?""  
>Doc:  (Defensive)  ""I'd assume you didn't understand biology and and would ask a few diagnostic questions to narrow it down.""  
>Me:  ""I just told you.  It hurts.  I thought you knew about medicine?""  
>Doc:  ""How can I help you if you won't tell me what actually hurts?""  
>Me:  ""EXACTLY MY POINT!""  

That was a ""come to Jesus"" moment for my friend, and he started being a bit more descriptive.  I also would later hear from him that he ended up being an ""IT Liaison"" at his hospital since he was able to more accurately describe problems to the IT help desk than his colleagues.

Edit:  First, thanks to /u/jakimfett for the Gold!

Second, a few of you mentioned this story sounds familiar.  There are a few reasons that might be:

- I've told this story in shortened form in the comments here and on other forums (likely on fark.com) in years past.

- Other people have also used very similar analogies.

- A combination of the above, AND I've stripped out a lot of the idiosyncratic parts of the conversation that only two friends would have but bears little relevance to the conversation (talking about cars, talking about hot miserably hot the weather was, talking about how jealous I was that he managed to get a 3GS so quickly, etc.)."
talesfromtechsupport,"Ok so this little gem started yesterday, currently working in managed print industry - customer logs a call saying no devices in a building are working, so definitely server/software related.

I log in with their IT, the server is freezing and when logging in with a new account there is a disk space error. So i inform him he needs to clear it down or add some HDD space and we can then troubleshoot anything if there are issues once its done.

Call the end user who logged the call, and let her know but... it makes no sense to her, depressing conversation occurs:

>Me: Morning, just calling regarding your printing issues at site X, its due to a server fault your IT are looking into - they should hopefully have it resolved soon which will likely resolve your issues.

>User: Oh, well the printer still isnt working, none of them are, this is URGENT.

>Me: I understand, but your IT is looking into it due to a server fault and should have it sorted as soon as possible.

>User: Ok, so when are you coming out to fix it?

>Me: I would not be able to fix the machine on site, it is a server issue as its run out of disk space, and your IT are looking into it.

>User: This is urgent the ENTIRE site cant print, whats the ETA on the fix?

>Me: I am not your IT so i am unable to advise, you would have to call them as they need to resolve it.

>User: I need an ETA to inform the users and management.

>Me: Im not in your IT so i cant give an ETA unfortuantely.

>User: Talk to my manager.

>Manager: we need an ETA for the fix or send someone on site, i want this actioned ASAP.

>Me: I'm not your IT, i'm from the managed print support company, the issue is with your server and your IT are looking to fix it. An engineer from us wont be able to assist.

>Manager: So you are categorically stating YOUR print engineer cant fix the printer? What kind of support is this?!

>Me: The issue isn't with the printer, its with the server the print software is on, which your IT are looking to fix urgently.

>Manager: No, the PRINTER is not PRINTING so its a PRINTER problem, we don't have servers.

>Me: You do have servers, it's what governs the pull print and login for the devices, and it's currently down, your IT are looking to fix it.

>Manager: why are you refusing to fix this? You can't just say no we have a support contract!

>Me: Your IT fix your servers, we fix the printers and the software thats on the server. You need to call your IT.

>Manager: Im escalating this to my director - expect a call back shortly

*Click*

What - the - actual - fuck.

Had several calls since then i have ignored - informed their account manager whats going on - this is now his mountain of stupid to deal with.

Tl:DR printers don't work - server has no space on C drive, IT fixing - IM NOT THE USERS FUCKING IT TEAM.

"
talesfromtechsupport,"Last night I did a scheduled upgrade of Quickbooks for a client. 1 server, 10 desktops, 3 databases. Went well.

As usual with an upgrade like this I'm scheduled to be on site the next day for a couple of hours to help out / answer questions about the new version. In this case scheduled for Monday morning since like most offices they're closed over the weekends.

Cell phone rings this morning at 7:30am. I don't recognize the number so I ignore it. They then proceed to call back continuously for the next 10 minutes, never leaving a message until the last call. I listen to the message - it's from a staff person at the client where I upgraded Quickbooks, irate as hell yelling ""QUICKBOOKS IS BROKEN! I CAN'T DO MY JOB! THIS IS GOING TO COST THE COMPANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS! YOU BETTER DAMN WELL GET THIS FIXED. GET OVER HERE! CALL ME BACK IMMEDIATELY!"" etc.

So I remote in to the remote desktop server, verify that all is well, take a deep breath and call her back. She proceeds to berate me until she runs out of breath, never tells me what the problem is but instead focuses on how her inability to enter some transactions she didn't get to Friday is going to cause the end of life on this planet. After several minutes I finally get her to tell me what problem she's having when she runs the program.

""IT WON'T START!""

""Does it give you an error message when you try to start it? What do you see?""

""I CAN'T RUN IT! THERE'S NO ICON ON THE DESKTOP! YOU NEED TO GET OUT HERE AND FIX THIS NOW! YOU'RE KILLING THE COMPANY!""

I remote into her system. The icon is there - in the exact same place as it was before - but it's a different icon. Still titled ""Quickbooks"" of course, but it's a different color. I tell her to watch the screen, double click it and of course QB comes right up.

I remind her that this is a new version and that some commands / screens will look a bit different. She accuses me of screwing around with it just to make things more difficult for her. I tell her that's not the case, ask her if there's anything else I can do to assist. A couple more ugly comments from her and we end the call.

My phone system sends me voicemails as emails with MP3 attachments. I forwarded the email to the owner of the company and told him I expect to be treated more professionally in the future. Frankly I hope it costs her her job.

Screw this and to hell with people like this.



**Monday update:** Went into the client's office this morning to assist with any issues they might have with the new version of QB (none to speak of). Complainer stayed out of my way, literally left her desk while I was in the vicinity. As I was getting ready to leave the owner of the firm called me into his office this morning and apologized for her voicemail tirade, said he'd have a talk with her. I was cordial, told him no need to, etc. and didn't bring up her behavior when I was trying to help her. As I left he had her in his office and was playing back the voicemail. 

About a half hour later she called and apologized. Sounded very beaten down, it was clear he'd given her a major tongue lashing. Her apology was about as enthusiastic as that of a 6 year old caught stealing cookies but I took the high road, thanked her and told her I'd be happy to help her in the future. Didn't say any of the many things I would have liked to because reaming her out is not worth pissing off the guy who writes the checks.

Pretty much what I expected to happen. The owner's a solid guy. Has been a client for over 12 years. 

"
talesfromtechsupport,"This happened a while back but it's still the best thing that ever happened to me at work. True story.

So, i was hired by a big defense company (upgrade tanks, naval weapons, etc) with over 3500 employees. You can imagine this was a very big company. We were in building 34 and if you needed to go somewhere quick you took a bike or an electric car.


I usually did 2nd line support, but they had a couple of people call in sick and asked me to do first line support. It was a friday and not much was happening, besides the usual emailproblems and tech guys turning off unix machines that needed a checkdisk command with admin rights.

The phone rings.

> Yes hello, this the secretary of the CEO. We need you to come over NOW! We have a big problem.

> ME: What seems to be wrong?

> Her: Mr CEO is trying to open a file in Word, but everytime he does this, scrambled text is showing up. I THINK WE ARE BEING HACKED! 

(this was a big issue, since a couple of weeks before this a group of activists broke into the company and climbed on top of our radar tower)

> Me: I'll take a look from here and take over your screen. Hang on.

So i take over his screen this is what happens:
File, open: JKAHSFHJKHJHJJJJJJFJJJJJSAKKKALALLLALLALLALALLAL*UUU**JJJDKJKJASLKLKSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

> HER: I don't know what this is. You see?!? THis is so weird...

Now, i knew what was wrong at this moment, but i wanted to see in person. You don't just walk into the exec office every day.

> ME: Uhuh. I'll be there as soon as possible!


So i grab this electric car, drive over and 5 minutes later i walk into the executive building. A very nice building, totally different from the rest of the offices. 

They even had their own dining room and bar. THe security guy sees me coming and waves me through, he was informed of my coming and 

understood the importance.
I get out of the elevator at the top floor and am greeted by the secretary, a manager and some other assistent, all a bit panicked.
> Come over, have a look at this! The ceo says..


He shows me:
File, open: JKAHSFHJKHJHJJJJJJFJJJJJSAKKKALALLLALLALLALALLAL*UUU**JJJDKJKJASLKLKSSSSSSSSSSSSSS


So i look at him. I look at every single person in that room. You could feel the suspense. I look back at the computer. I pick up the newspaper that was on top of the keyboard and ask:

> try again please?

The looks on their face: Priceless.
(Got a free lunch with the CEO)

talesfromtechsupport,"A customer of ours has all their server and networking equipment support through us and the helpdesk  services from other company. I went on-site to investigate a network issue, when I was interrupted by a very aggravated employee of theirs. She insistent I would come fix some issue on her workstation like RIGHT NOW. I explain her I can't, we don't do their support. A following conversation unfolds:

    me: I'm sorry, but I don't do end-user cases
    her: WHAT did you just call me??!
    me: (puzzled) end-user?
    her: IS THAT SOME SORT OF A DEROGATORY TERM, HUH?

After that there's no calming her, she fumes on about being insulted and listens to no voice of reason. In the end I just ignore her and finish my work. The next day my boss comes to me about having received a complaint about my conduct. He says he's very surprised about the accusation as I'm normally pretty calm and professional about what I do. I explain him what had happened, my boss bursts into laughter and walks away."

After reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2kgh4e/the_mothership_is_following_me_via_gps/) tale by /u/jayykidd, it brought back memories of a client of my own that was Paranoid and Rightly So (as an aside, /u/jayykidd, we are totally making PARS a thing around here). 

As a bit of backstory, I spent five years doing IT consulting in a rural town about an hour from Portland, OR. I worked for a small company with a few other consultants and a couple of bench techs. My job was primarily server/network engineering-centric, but having done my time as a front-line tech I'd periodically involve myself in the more interesting/complex cases we'd see from our walk-in customers. 

One day we had a woman come in. She caught my eye because she was in her late thirties or early forties, and actually quite attractive. She had short, platinum blonde hair and bright red lips, and was dressed and styled like she was transplanted right out of a 1950's era magazine ad. One of our bench techs greets her and starts talking to her. Right out the gate I can tell she is panicked and, by the sound of it, tin-foil hat levels of crazy. Shit, there goes any desire I had to flirt with her and maybe see if I could buy her a drink. I listen in on the conversation anyways, because it's at least a change of pace from the monotony of my day-to-day.

After a few minutes of her going on about how her husband is spying on her through all manner of devices, my bench tech looks back at me with a *can-you-please-come-help-me-and-make-her-go-away* look on his face. I oblige, as I appreciated that the front-line guys respected me enough to ask for my help on these things. I walked up front, introduced myself as the supervisor, and told her that since her issue was so unique and serious it'd probably be best if our more senior staff handled it. Now that I was seeing her up close, I could tell that under her classy outfit and Marilyn Monroe-esque makeup was a deeply distraught woman. Her eyes looked baggy, and tired. Like she had been up too late crying.  

Obviously, at this point I'm just playing along. This isn't my first rodeo, and generally what happens is the client claims some individual or three letter agency is monitoring their computer, we tell them our hourly rate for forensics ($150 an hour), and suddenly the men-in-black-suits watching them aren't that big of a deal anymore. Now, to be fair, we actually *did* specialize in computer forensics and data recovery, working extensively with the local police department and a handful of legal firms on a number of cases where they needed expert help, we even had a guy on staff full-time who wore that hat most days. The local police were pretty small-time and farmed out at least some of their computer crime related work to us on contract. In the cases where people *did* want to pay, we would do our due diligence, and prepare a professional report of our findings accordingly.  We would meet with attorneys and testify in court, as necessary. Generally it was fairly benign stuff like gathering chat logs and browser history for a divorce proceeding where one spouse accused the other of cheating or something similar, and wanted evidence to back that up.  

Back to the client at hand. She insists her husband is monitoring her every move, tracking her vehicle, monitoring her computer, and recording her in her own home. Here's where it gets interesting: She claims that she *knows* all of this, because he has told her about it. In fact, he has gone so far as to threaten her life if she tries to tamper with any of it. She says she has tried to apply for a protective order against him, but ostensibly without some sort of evidence of his behavior, nobody would take her seriously. 

I give her the crazy litmus test and I tell her that in order to gather evidence discreetly we would need two of our senior consultants to investigate. $300 an hour, four hour minimum. 

She pulls out her wallet. 

Fuck, she's serious. 

We agree to start with her vehicle to check for signs of the GPS tracker. She says she is parked several blocks away so her husband won't know she came to a computer store (we were in a downtown area surrounded by retail stores). So I grab my toolbag and holler at one of my colleagues (who has been tuned in himself from his back office desk) to join me. 

So the lady, myself, my colleague, and BOTH of our now intensely curious bench techs (all of us in matching company polos) follow this lady down the street to her car. What a motley crew we must have been. We get to her minivan begin our process of looking for this GPS device. Now, GPS trackers (at least the commercially available ones) require two things, generally: dedicated 12v power and an unobstructed (at least by metal) view of the sky. They basically use GPS to grab the coordinates and then a GSM/CDMA (cellular) signal to relay the positional data to a web interface or something. So there really aren't that many places they can really be mounted that are both effective and discreet. We spend some time looking around the undercarriage, rocker panels, and even bits of the interior. Battery doesn't have any additional leads running off of it, fuse box isn't tapped anywhere for power. Nothing. Just as I'm starting to lose faith that this may not be quite as exciting as I had perhaps hoped, I find the fucking thing.

It was tiny, not much bigger than a flash drive, and mounted behind the front grille. It looked pretty much exactly like [this](http://www.amazon.com/LandAirSea-LAS-1505-Tracking-Vehicle-System/dp/B000H9E9UG). 

The reason it didn't need auxiliary power is that it wasn't an active device. This device did not provide real-time tracking, rather it used some internal memory and a couple AAA batteries to log GPS data for days at a time. At some point, when the van was not in use, the guy would grab the GPS device, upload the data to his laptop, maybe swap batteries, then remount it to the car. 

Fucking hell, this lady was very much indeed Paranoid And Rightfully So. 

Now that we've established that she isn't batshit insane but that she actually *is* being tracked by her husband, the tone amongst our team became drastically more serious. Obviously, something sinister is going on, and we aren't sure what, but by the sound of things this lady really is fearful of her life. She has entrusted *us* to gather evidence and help her get a protective order against him, which is something I think all of us took quite seriously.

We show her the tracker and she breaks down into tears because it's the first evidence she has physically seen. We take photos of it, and carefully install it back where it belongs. I sort of assumed that a GPS tracker on your fucking car would be proof enough for a judge to issue at least a temporary protective order, but she seemed insistent that she would need more evidence to make it stick.

Our next moves have to be conducted very deliberately. She claims that her home is bugged, and so is her computer. We will need to go onsite to investigate accordingly, but it will have to be at a time when both her husband isn't home and when we will be able to quickly create a report for her, leaving her enough time to get a protective order before the day's end. We couldn't chance him coming home later, reviewing whatever it was he was recording, and finding out that she had taken action to have him investigated. 

It wasn't going to be for at least a week before there was a time that was just right. We made arrangements with her back at the office and I offered to walk her back to her car. She accepted, and on the way she confided in me many of the personal details of her life and her obviously abusive relationship with her husband. In the interest of protecting her privacy I'll simply say that it sounded like she finally figured out how manipulative he was, and when she said she wanted out he wasn't about to let that happen. I asked her again if she really was afraid for her life, and the sincerity of her ""yes"" was both scary and heartbreaking for me. I asked her if she had thought about getting a gun, and she said she had, but that he would notice the large sum of money needed to purchase one missing from their joint account. 

As the gravity of the situation weighed on me, I offered to let her borrow one of mine. She was awestruck, but I assured her that it was completely okay. At the time, I had several handguns and rifles, and I couldn't think of a more appropriate situation for someone to have one. My car was parked close by, and we walked over to it. I tried to gather some idea of her familiarity with guns, as the thought of giving one to more or less a complete stranger, especially one that might not know what to do with it, was unsettling to me. It sounded like she had at least a basic understanding of their function, had gone shooting before, etc. In my mind the pros of her having at least some means to protect herself outweighed the cons, so I moved forward. In the trunk, I had a [Ruger LCP](http://www.ruger.com/products/lcp/models.html), which is a very small .380 caliber handgun that I kept in my Get Home Bag/emergency survival kit. It was fitted with the factory installed Crimson Trace laser grips, which I had dialed in to about 10 meters. We went over the basics of how to use it safely, I showed her how the laser worked, and told her that, for her situation, all she had to know was that the bullet would go more or less where the red dot of the laser was. She was crying, and frankly at this point I pretty much was, too. I gave her my cell phone number and told her to call me if she needed someone to talk to. We hugged for a while before parting ways. It wasn't a romantic hug or anything, it was that kind of hug that's exchanged when someone *needs to be held*. Like, when your best mate tells you his mom passed away or something. She needed the comfort of knowing that she wasn't alone, that at least one person took her seriously, and I'd like to think that I gave her some hope that things would be *okay*. 

The next week was tense, as we prepared for our investigation. My coworkers and I spent considerable time discussing and researching ways to triage her computer to look for evidence, as well as how to approach the search of the house. When the day finally came, we arrived onsite at the specified time armed with our forensics tools, flashlights, laptops...anything we might need. 

I set to work immediately on her computers (a home desktop and a personal laptop) while two of my colleagues began their search of the house. I removed the drives from her PCs, and using a USB write-blocker, (which physically prevented me from writing/modifying any information on her drives) I made a clone of both drives. For the sake of speed, both drives were cloned to SSDs. Once cloned, I put the PCs back they way they were and began mounting the cloned volumes and investigating. The drives were mounted into a quarantine VM, with no WLAN access. Scanning the drives with a number of antimalware programs didn't turn anything up. Looking through the file system however (paying special attention to hidden files and protected system files), turned up some things that didn't look quite right (filenames and directories that looked obfuscated). I made the call to boot up both PCs off of the cloned SSDs and look that them live to see if maybe I could catch an obfuscated process running, or something. 

Nothing.

With nothing else open, I ran a *netstat -an* out of CMD. There were a handful of TCP connections active. One by one, I started performing DNS lookups on the IPs. Everything was normal active connections for background processes like Skype. Then, I found it. An active connection to a clearly obfuscated domain name. It looked like a license key with a *.com* at the end of it. Something like 24W25-188EGFF-98001QRD.com. 

It was hiding in plain sight, and it was registered to SpectorSoft Corporation. Guess what they sell? Yup. Surveillance software.

The PC was running something called [Spector Pro](http://www.spectorsoft.com/products/SpectorPro_Windows/), which was capable of monitoring all of the users activities, browsing history, keylogging, even sending remote screen captures to a mobile phone or email based on target keywords. It was the full nine yards for monitoring. 

I screen capped everything for my logs, shut the system down, and swapped the forensic SSDs for the original disks to put everything back the way it was. 

Not too long after, our other two guys found some evidence of their own. Two separate (and frankly, rather rudimentary) CMOS cameras hidden in the master bedroom. One in the closet in a shoebox, one in the smoke detector in the ceiling. Both, if I recall correctly, were simply wired to 9V batteries and recorded to SD cards. All things considered, they were pretty low tech. The contents of the memory cards would have had to be moved off at least once a day, and the battery probably changed at least as often. 

We didn't touch anything. Lots of photographs were taken. We went back to the office and compiled all of the evidence into a document for her, and I passed the disk images onto our forensics guy for further evaluation. I met with the client later that day to present her the report so she could furnish it to the court. 

The gratitude she had for us was absolutely immeasurable. We didn't charge her for our services. Getting to play a role in stopping her sick fuck of a husband from engaging in whatever it is he was doing was payment enough.

I'd like to tell you that I know how this story ends. I'd like to say that the guy was put away in jail forever, and my supreme IT prowess and white-knightery wooed her into my arms and we lived happily ever after. But frankly, I don't really know what happened. What I *can* tell you that about a week after we gave her our report, I met her for coffee at a place across the street. She looked visibly better. Her puffy, tired eyes were gone, replaced instead by ones that seemed to glisten with warmth. Her skin was radiant and beautiful. She was smiling, for the first time I'd seen. An immense weight had been lifted off of her, and it showed. She told me that she was temporarily living with her mom and dad, that a restraining order was in place on her estranged husband, and that she was finally filing for divorce. She told me that for the first time in a very long time she felt safe, and that she felt happy. 

In the parking lot, she gave me back the little handgun, profusely thanking me again for the work we did. She hugged me, both of us teary-eyed, and we parted ways. For me, it proved to be one of the most emotionally rewarding experiences of my career. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who's gilded this post! It's definitely put a smile on my face."

The email was pretty self-explanatory. ""Due to recent reports of alleged security problems by an intern, I have had to temporarily block access to spotify. I apologize for the inconvenience.""

It got around relatively quickly that Jack was the one responsible. Two of the interns quit. They stopped playing music out loud. None of them talked to Jack.

He wasn't in the intern room for very long anyway. About a week after his hire, Boss's Wife decided to let Jack just use her office while she wasn't there, presumably because he complained about how the interns were all being so very mean to him.

*

Day 8. I got an email from Jack. ""I'm having issues accessing Buzzfeed.""

I didn't even move from my chair, emailing back a simple reply: ""Due to management concerns, Buzzfeed is not allowed per our firewall settings.""

His email was immediate. ""Please? I just want to check some things while I'm on lunch.""

I replied back a simple ""No"" and went about my day. and that was the last I ever heard from Jack.

I'm kidding. *Of course it wasn't.*

*

Day 9. Someone had opened my desk. See, I have a laptop in my desk. The laptop is set up to bypass the firewall if we need it, like if we need to find a business by looking them up on facebook or read a news article on a usually-blocked news site. It's common knowledge I have it.

Someone had unlocked my desk and taken the laptop.

I stormed down to the officer manager's desk. She and I have the only two keys to my desk. I told her that my desk had been opened and that a company laptop was missing.

""Oh?"" she said, confused. ""Boss came down here and needed the key to your desk.""

""Boss!?"" I was taken aback. ""I...alright."" Maybe Boss needed the laptop for something, I told myself. But that didn't stop me from going straight to Boss' Wife's office.

There, sitting at the polished hardwood desk, sat Jack, with my laptop. And my desk key next to it.

I approached. ""Jack, I need you to give me that back.""

Jack shook his head. ""I got approval from Boss. The computer in here was acting funny, so I asked if I could use your spare laptop and he said yes.""

I was completely stunned. ""So you asked Boss to get you the key to my desk--"" I picked the desk key up and put it in my pocket--""then take my laptop, and use it for..."" I looked over the screen. Two windows docked side by side: Facebook and Cheezburger. ""...this?""

He shifted the laptop so I couldn't see the screen and cleared his throat like I was intruding on his private data. ""Thanks. You can go now.""

*You can go now.*

*You. Can. Go. Now.*

Nope. Nope, nope, nope. Shit doesn't work like this, man. I felt like I wanted to just slap the child sitting in front of me, but I steadied my hand and took a breath. The only laptop with unrestricted internet access was in the hand of a spoiled intern.

The only laptop with unrestricted access.

I smiled at Jack. ""Alright, no problem. Have a good day."" I walked out of the office.

I had a plan. Jack was fucking going **down**.

talesfromtechsupport,"> $ME = ME

> $hit = Head of IT.

> $HHR = Head of HR

> $EVPIT = Executive Vice President of IT and Technology. (Yes… I know) 

So yesterday was strange, to say the least. The meeting was scheduled for noon so the beginning of my day was pretty mundane. Handled a few issues with users who had purchased their own machines because “ours were not fast enough,” even though the ones they bought were supplied by us. But cest la vie. 

At noon I walked into the conference room for the video review. $HIT was in there as well as the executive vice president of IT and technology. (yes I know) The conference started hilariously as the head of HR, or $HHR, could not get her video working. 

I walked her through how to fix that as it was a simple error. 

> $ME – Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in?

> $HHR – Oh duh. Should have known it was something stupid like that. 

We started the conference and HOOO BOOOY. She was gunning for me hard. 

> $HHR – So I have in front of me 19 complaints against you this year. Can you explain these?

> $ME – That’s it?

> $HHR - *Clearly not expecting that.* Uhh yes. How do you explain it?

> $ME – Well as you well know, each complaint is different and most do not have merit. 

> $HHR – So you are saying these complaints were made…incorrectly?

> $ME – Yes that is exactly what I am saying. 

I pulled out the same folder she probably had. 

> $Me – On Feb 12th *User* complained that I refused his request. 

> $HHR – Good one to start with? Explain it. 

> $ME - *user* wanted me to put a folder on his desktop that would allow him to transfer items between his local desktop and citrix. This is not possible unless he works on the domain…which he does not. I offered him several alternative options but he refused each one. He only wanted the original option of a folder on his desktop. 

> $HHR – So this was impossible?

> $ME – Technology wise of course it is possible. We could have set him up with an FTP option to direct into his session. But that would never EVER get the approval. 

> $HHR – Lets move on to the next one. *Different user* Claimed that you were rude to her on the phone and hung up on her. 

> $me – Lets play the call log. 

The call log is me being professional while she politely berates me on the phone…until she cusses me out. I terminate the call and send it to HR. 

> $Me – That call is the reason why SHE is fired. Your predecessor said I handled it well. 

> $HHR – Ok lets move on to the lady who had to wait 4 extra days to get her laptop back from you.

> $ME – Name?

> $HHR - *lady who yelled in my face* said you helped her 3 days in a row and finally took an extra 4 days to get her laptop back to her. 

> $ME – You mean the lady who yelled in my face and got fired because of it? Yeah I remember her. I had to go to the hospital that Friday so none of my work got done. 

> $HHR – I see the note here. You thought you had a hernia but it turned out to be a UTI?

> $ME – Thanks for repeating it here… Yes. Anyways the point is her laptop was finished within 2 hours of me returning to work. The 4 days she is talking about is because we had a 3 day weekend.

The meeting went on like this for well over 30 minutes as we ran through each complaint with only 1 that was legitimate. I misread a technical error and had to fix it 30 minutes later. Oh well. Then came the real kicker. 

> $HHR – Lets talk about the fire you started. 

> $ME – I STARTED!?

> $HIT – HE STARTED!? (same time.)

> $EVPIT – Wait what?

> $HHR – Per your report. The fuse box was overloaded when the third rack of servers plugged in and started a fire inside the wall that ended up burning out most of the building. 

> $ME – Yes that does sound correct. What your report failed to mention on the report, which I have in front of me because I FUCKING sent it. (Yes I did say that.) The circuit breaker was not an actual circuit breaker. It was a bypass installed to bring the building up to code. The fuse box had cabinets built over it so that the owner could hide it. When too much was plugged into a mains line, which was rated to handle it, the fuse should have blown. But there was about 50 cents worth of pennies shoved in there. 

> $HHR – How was this missed. 

> $ME – I don’t know. I am not an electrician, I am not a state building inspector, I am not omniscient, and I am certainly not omnipotent. I went in to set up an office. 

> $HHR – You appear to have an excuse for everything. 

> $ME – Yes its called CYA. You literally have that on a poster in your office. 

> $HHR – Now lets talk about your language to me yesterday. 

> $ME – How about lets talk about your blatant disregard for the termination procedures you set in place. You created a paper snafu for my worker because you could not help yourself but to stick your nose where it does not belong. If you had followed procedure and not sent the termination paperwork through, he would have health insurance right now. Instead you decided to play tech and fired someone in the system. I spent 4 hours yesterday chasing paperwork and trying to keep this knowledge from him. 

> $HHR – I Do not appreciate your attitude. 

> $ME – And I do not appreciate you taking actions on your own. You may be HR but even you are not allowed to terminate employees without

> $EVPIT – OK That is far enough you have made your point $me. Remember that $HHR holds your job in her hand.

> $hit – Like a small bird.

> $EVPIT – Thank you $hit. So you do need to show her some respect…that being said. $HHR? He is right. You violated company policy, you tried to terminate an employee when it was not called for, and you created a mountain out of a single email. (Turning to me) Do you want to keep your job?

> $Me – Yes. 

> $EVPIT – Then never take a disrespectful tone or cuss at a member of the senior management again. I expect a written apology to her by the end of the day. No further action needs to be taken here. (Turning to the monitor that has $HHRs face on it) As for you. 

> $HHR – Yes?

> $EVPIT – You will apologize to both him and the employee you tried to terminate by the end of the day yourself. While he was disrespectful, cussed, and generally made an ass of himself, he is not wrong. You did overreact and wrongfully terminate a good worker forcing $ME here into overdrive trying to stop it in its tracks. You could have solved this by going to $ME when you first heard about it. I heard the call log and read everything about this incident. Simply put the end user was an idiot and needs to trust the people she calls to fix her computer. 

EVPIT stood up and gathered his things. 

> $EVPIT – Hopefully this is the last I hear of any animosity towards upper management, or animosity coming from upper management. Good day people. 

EVPIT left and I went back to my desk apologizing for the attitude I took with the head of HR. At 4:55 PM the email came in from the head of HR apologizing for her role. I then had 5 minutes to explain to the tech what happened. He decided he owed me a lunch. 

I miss the Wahoo Lady. "
talesfromtechsupport,"So I go out to a call where the desktop is not powering on.  Go out there and the first thing I find is a Springfield XD 9mm sitting on top of the machine.  This client is kinda known for keeping random guns in random places and I know the lady who's computer this is knows jack shit about guns.

I point to it and say ""what do you want me to do with this?"" and she says ""is the safety on?""  I'm a gun guy but I've never handled an XD so I confuse the mag release with the safety and drop the magazine.  At this point I'm fairly sure it has a round in the tube so I tell her I'm going to work the slide to eject the bullet.

Sure enough, I eject one out on her desk and now she is asking me where the safety is.  I'm not seeing one other than the Glock type trigger so I tell her there isn't one and that keeping it hot like that is probably a bad idea.  I have to explain that you can put a mag in the gun without putting one in the chamber and all you have to do is jack the slide and it will be ready to shoot.

I'm an IT guy out on a computer call and I had to break down how a semi-automatic pistol works to a customer....fucking tuesdays."

""Dude...your self-control must be like Gandhi."" My friend Steve, who works for one of my company's clients, heard me ranting about Jack while we had a coffee.

I shook my head. ""I know. But what am I gonna do? Slap him? Get myself fired?""

""Sounds like it'd be worth it.""

I sighed and took a steadying sip of my coffee. ""I have a plan, though. But I need your help.""

He perked up and then scowled. ""My help? Oh, no. I don't like this guy much, but--""

""I'll put the whole story on reddit if you help me.""

He thought about it. ""Alright, but on one condition: You tell everyone that I am the hero that made your evil plan possible.""

And so, for the record, Steve became the hero who made my evil plan possible.

Day 11. I got a call from Boss. ""Clickity, I just got a call from Jack.""

*Of course you did.* ""What seems to be the problem, Boss?""

""He says you've made his new computer not work.""

I blinked, staring at the speaker phone. ""*His* new computer? You mean our unrestricted computer that he's...using?""

""Yes, yes, that one."" I could almost see Boss lean in to the speakerphone. ""I don't know what your problem is, Clickity, but Jack complains that you're preventing him from working. So i need you to fix his computer now."" Click.

As if on cue (or more, as if he had been outside the office listening) Jack appeared at my doorway with the laptop. ""So I need you to undo whatever you did."" He opened the laptop and sat it in front of me, on top of my paperwork as if to say *You know...Regardless of whatever you were doing ten seconds ago.*

I seethed, pulling out a usb drive and plugging it into the laptop. I grumbled wordlessley as I clicked a few buttons on the laptop and then a few on my computer. I unplugged the USB drive and closed the laptop. ""There. Have a nice day.""

Jack picked up the laptop and turned for the door. ""You better not screw with me again.""

As soon as he was gone I smashed my pencil sharpener with my fist.

Day 14. It was the perfect day. Boss's wife was in the office so Jack was sharing her desk and, from the looks of my remote viewer, doing absolutely nothing at all.

I sent out an email.

> To: Internemail@company

> From: clickity@company

> Subject: Intern Appreciation day

> Hiya interns! I just cleared this with the office manager. For your hard work, I'm treating you guys to lunch. Go see the office manager and pick up a (Local Pub and Burger Joint) gift card and have a great day. Thanks for your hard work!

A few minutes later the phone rang. Boss's wife's office.

""IT, this is Clickity.""

""This is Jack. I just saw all the interns walk out...what's going on?""

""Oh, it's intern appreciation day. Didn't you get the email? I sent it to the...oh."" I sighed. ""I completely forgot to send it to your email because it's separate. Yeah, all the interns are getting lunch.""

""Thanks for letting me know,"" Jack said with audible edge to his voice. ""If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have told me at all, would you--"" He's cut off by a disapproving ""tsk"" from Boss's wife.

I cleared my throat and ignored Jack's I-Own-You attitude. ""Go quick and you can still catch them--""

""Fine."" Jack hung up the phone.

I took a few reassuring breaths and texted Steve."

I'm not IT, I just happen to be one of the few in our office who knows his way around the computer, so I often get asked for help. Usually it's just 'My MSWord doesn't work' or something, but this one really stuck with me.

talesfromtechsupport,"When I started working for my current company there was a customer who was already infamous.  He was one of those people who was known only by his first name.  Everyone knew exactly who you were talking about when you said you'd had to take a call from Vladimir.  

They tried to protect me, as the newbie, from Vladimir as long as possible, but one day when I'd been at the company for maybe six months it just couldn't be avoided.  No one else was available but me, and he was in a royal fury.  The operator called me up, apologized to me (even she knew who he was) and told me that she had no one else to take him.  I reluctantly agreed to take the call.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, this is the exchange the operator had with him immediately before she passed him to me.

> **Operator:** I'm going to pass you to Merkuri22.  She's new.

> **Vladimir:** *(shouts)* I don't want somebody new!  I want somebody who knows something!

> **Operator:** *(shouts back)* She knows a lot, Vladimir!! *(slams down receiver, passing him to me)*

Vladimir's no Bob.  He's a fairly intelligent guy, but he gets frustrated super quick, and has a very hot temper.  I swear, sometimes when he calls us he doesn't want his issue to be fixed, he just wants to let us know the torture our product is putting him through.  He calls us to be a martyr on the line, and shout at us about how terrible the product is.  And my first call with him was one of those.

Luckily, Operator was right.  I knew a lot.  I had picked up on our products super quick, and the issue he called me about was a piece of cake.  The hard part was getting him to shut up long enough to tell him the solution to his issue.  I managed to calm him down and fix his problem, and not long after that I had become his favorite tech.  It had very quickly gone from, ""I don't want to talk to her!!!"" to, ""Get me Merkuri22!  I need to speak to Merkuri22!  Nobody else can solve my problems, *nobody!!*""

***

I learned to read his moods like a medium reading tea leaves.  Sometimes it was best to meet his fire with a the cool exterior of a nurse at a mental hospital explaining why we don't hit other patients, and other times I could only get his attention by spitting flames back in his face.

Other techs could always tell when I was talking to Vladimir because they'd hear a one-sided conversation that went something like this:

> **Me:** Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* *VLADIMIR!!* *Pause.* You know I'm trying to help you, right?  Do you want me to get this working for you, or not?  *Pause.* Okay, then let me explain what's happening here...

***

Many times in my career I've compared what I do to the TV show House.  Tech support is a lot like diagnosing a patient.  I frequently tell my techs, ""Customers lie,"" (playing on House's ""Patients lie"") and every time I say it I'm thinking of Vladimir.  This is why I swear sometimes he'd call up just to try to prove to me that our product is crap, because he'd frequently lie to me about what did and didn't work.  He'd tell me whatever would mean he needed to be in a panicked state, up against a deadline that he could not possibly meet, all because our products suck.

One time he called me up with an issue where I knew exactly what it was.  I'd just solved it for another customer the day before.  We were on a remote meeting and I could see his screen.

> **Vladimir:** I tried *everything* and *nothing* works!

> **Me:** Oh, I know what this is.  You need to do <solution>.

> **Vladimir:** I *told* you!  I *tried* that and *it didn't work!*

> **Me:** *(thinks) That's impossible, it has to work when you do that.*

> **Me:** What exactly did you do?

> **Vladimir:** I did <exactly what I told him> and *it didn't work!  Nothing works!  I told you!*

> **Me:** Can you do it again so I can see the steps you took?

> **Vladimir:** *I TOLD YOU I DID <solution> AND IT DIDN'T WORK!*

> **Me:** Vladimir, calm down.  Can you do it one more time?  Do it for me?

> **Vladimir:** *(calmer)* Fine.  I'll do it again for you.  See, I do this, and I click here, and I don't see-- oh, it's working this time!  You're the best!  I always know when I call you up that you'll fix it for me!

***

A few years later, Vladimir's favorite support grunt (me) was promoted to manager.  I was a working manager for a while, trying to manage my team and take calls at the same time, but that proved to not be very efficient, and after years of that I reduced the calls I directly took down to almost nothing.  Vladimir was *not* pleased.

One day he was having a hissy fit, and was demanding to speak to no one but me, even though he'd been told many times that I was now a manager and didn't take direct calls.  This particular day I was in and out of meetings about another customer who was legitimately having serious issues, and I couldn't make time for Vladimir.  There were times when the operator literally couldn't find me because I was bouncing between conference rooms and upper management offices.  

At one point the operator (now a different woman from earlier in this post) came and found me physically.  She was crying.  She told me about how upset Vladimir was, and how he was demanding to speak to me and wouldn't let her pass him to anyone else on the team, and she didn't know what to do.

I was *livid*.  I still didn't have time to call him back because that other customer's issue was far from over and there were political ramifications I had to juggle, but I took a few minutes to write Vladimir a scathing email.  I told him that it was not the operator's fault that I wasn't available, shouting at her wouldn't make me come to the phone any faster, and that he was sabotaging his own attempts to get a solution by refusing to speak with the available qualified techs who were happy to help him with his issue.  I made sure he knew the operator's name, and that he'd made her cry.  Then I went back to trying to keep my other customer from hemorrhaging blood.

Not long after I sent that email, the operator found me again, and told me that this had happened...

> **Operator:** Thank you for calling <company>, how may I direct your call?

> **Vladimir:** Is this <operator's name>?

> **Operator:** *(recognizes his voice, tenses up)* Yes, it is.

> **Vladimir:** This is Vladimir.  I just wanted to apologize.  I did not mean to yell at you.  That was completely unacceptable of me.

> **Operator:** Wow... t-thank you!  That means a lot to me.  *Pause.* Do you want to talk to tech support?

> **Vladimir:** No, thanks, I just called to apologize.  Have a nice day.  *Click.*

That was one of my proudest moments as a manager, making Vladimir call back just to apologize.

***

He still calls us up every once in a while.  I haven't talked to him in years.  He's found another favorite, but every once and a while he still tells her about the way Merkuri22 used to do things, and tells her to go ask me for answers.  He still lies to her.  Sometimes she comes to me and says:

> **Tech:** Vladimir says the last time this happened you told him to do <x>.

> **Me:** I absolutely did not.

> **Tech:** I figured.

And sometimes I still hear from someone else's cube...

> Vladimir... Vladimir... VLADIMIR!  Listen to me!..."

I had been working as a small office's sysadmin for a little over two months when Jack was hired. Jack was a paid intern whose mother was friends with my boss's wife. Jack grew up in the wealthiest county in the state (where my Boss lives) and has had everything he ever wanted. A sense of entitlement that hung around him like the smell of five-day-old socks was the first thing I noticed upon being introduced to him as he went around the office.

""Jack, this is Clickity, our, erm...uh...tech...guy..."" My boss introduces me, in that way that old bosses who don't use computers often do.

Jack extends his hand. ""Oh, cool. Nice to meet ya.""

I shake. ""Welcome aboard.""

Jack is very eager to get started doing...whatever. ""Will I get a business email?"" as if this is the most interesting thing ever. Adorable, I think.

""Eventually, yes. For the moment though, we have a shared email for interns on staff. I'll get you the credentials shortly."" Most of the interns use the shared email for a while until getting their own. just standard procedure.

""You run the firewall, right?""

""Yes.""

""So you can block and unblock sites?""

""Yes."" Jack's eager smile is contagious.

""Cool! Nice to meet you."" He waves and the Boss and Jack leave to go be introduced elsewhere.

Now, dear reader, you might be wondering why I would call Jack the worst end user ever given his politeness and general smiling demeanor who has some understanding of what a sysadmin is, and what a sysadmin does. That's above average when it comes to end users.

Well, we're only getting started here with Jack.

--

The first thing jack did was complain the moment he was out of earshot. He apparently explained to the Boss that it really would be professional to have his own email given his experience and the fact that he was really more than just an intern. See, Jack knew his shit and that was that if he complained to Mother, she would complain to Boss-Wife, who would complain to Boss. And Boss, figuring an email is a small thing to ask for, had a request to set up a personalized email account for Jack on my desk within the hour.

This was not to be a good start of a relationship with one's IT Guy.

--

Day 2, I got an IT ticket for the room where the interns work. it's a large open office with a bunch of computers and printers where the interns print stuff all day long. Because it's such mind-numbing work, they tend to play music off of Pandora or Spotify in there. The ticket says:

""From INTERNEMAIL@companyemail: Hey, we're having issues with spotify. Not super important, but please help if you're free! thanks""

Aw, those guys are always nice to me. Maybe it's because I leave reddit unblocked on our firewall so they can reddit at lunch.

An hour or so later I have a few free minutes and I head down. I check out spotify and find the issue and fix it. Jack is there and watches closely.

""We can use Spotify here?"" he asks.

""Yep,"" I reply.

""Pandora works, too,"" another intern adds. Everything checks out and I leave the happy-again-they-can-play-music interns and Jack.

--

A couple hours later, I got a note on my desk. See, Boss knew I allowed people to play music and such at the office. He believed was that Spotify is a HUGE security risk, leaving holes in our firewall through which everything from viruses to malware to cyberterrorists could come through. Boss was unhappy that I would allow such a threat to exist in our system, and ordered me to close it up.

I called Boss. When I asked who told him these incorrect things about Spotify? Oh, Jack did, of course.

I explained that Spotify was not a threat, and that Jack was simply mistaken. Jack, however, was on the other end of the line, in Boss's office, on speakerphone, and interjected: ""Dude, it's alright if you didn't know about the security issue. But don't try and make me look bad for your mistake.""

I'm stunned as Boss hangs up the phone after demanding I fix it.

talesfromtechsupport,"Some university in Germany, around the turn of the century. The physics department had quite a nice setup for the students: two rooms with terminals, in one room all machines were HP-UX, the other room had a dual boot option: WindowsNT or Linux. All the userdata is stored on the server and accessible from all systems.

At the beginning of term the new students had their accounts created by one of the student supervisors on the Linux machines. $ME was the middle man between the student supervisors and the real techs who kept the system running. So I somehow got stuck with the support when the supervisors didn't know what to do.

One day a student---lets call her Samantha Melinda Butler---was send to me. She was quite into computing but had no idea why she had problems with her account. She was able to access her /home/ but she couldn't write to some files. On the other hand she had discovered that she could read nearly *all* the files in other peoples /home/---even in the accounts of some professors.

I asked her to log into her account and opened a terminal. I looked at her files, but everything seemed in order:

> ls -als .vimrc

>-rw-rw----   2 smb smb      1024 Jan 11 09:15 .vimrc

I tried to cd in my own /home/ and could access it. That shouldn't happen?!

> ls -als .vimrc

>-rw-rw----   2 cyrond cyrond      2048 Jan 19 07:42 .vimrc

She shouldn't be able to access this?!
Suddenly I looked at her username: she had asked for her initials. Samantha Melinda Butler---smb.

I su'ed in my own account:

>groups

>cyrond cdrom lpt smb

Samatha had become Samba and had all the rights of the ServerMessageBlock. And every user was a member of the group smb.

The student supervisor who had created Samantha's account didn't even get why this was his fault.

We later implemented this question into the test for new supervisors:

Richard Oot is a new student and wants a login created. As his username he wishes the first letter of his given name and his family name. How do you create his account on a Linux terminal?

talesfromtechsupport,"You don’t do any work on Friday in IT.  If it goes wrong, you’ll be there all weekend fixing it.

So, in the spirit of being careful, friday afternoon drinks were a tradition.  4pm Friday was beer o’clock, and as the resident only-person-not-excited-by-Crown-Lager, responsibility for arranging the drinks fell to me.  No big deal right?  Except that this was the day that I finally got an unlimited account with the local liquor store that would be billed to the company automatically.  I wasn’t going to waste it.  

I did not waste it.  Our small 10-person company got rip-roaringly drunk.  Like ‘arrested for being outside in this state’ drunk.  There was Jack Daniels cans stacked to the ceiling.  Chips had fallen liberally to the floor.  Someone couldn’t find a bin and filed a chicken wing in the file cabinet, under ‘C’, for chicken.  It was one of /those/ drinking sessions where everyone is just a total mess.  Around 9pm, after five solid hours of Aus-Spec partying, we broke off and headed into the night.  I wandered down to a nearby bar and watched some bands play for an hour, downed another jug of beer, and smiled to myself that the week had ended.  

Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.  

My phone buzzed in my pocket.  I ran outside, tripping up the stairs as I went, managed to steady myself against a signpost, and answered.  It was the CEO.  The primary and secondary route servers were down.  I stood frozen in time for an instant, the same way a deer looks at the headlights of an oncoming car, and then asked him to repeat himself.  

> CEO: YES BOTH THE ROUTE SERVERS ARE DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE IS OFFLINE GET IN THERE NOW FIX IT DO WHATEVER IT TAKES  

I cannot stress enough that these two servers were the most important thing our company had.  They, in and of themselves, were the primary thing around which our business existed, and all other things were secondary to them.  My state was by far the biggest, with some of the biggest ISPs and content providers in the country attached.  And this was the first full network outage we’d ever had.  And it was my problem.  And I’d consumed enough alcohol that my blood could have been used as a fire accelerant.  

I yelled .. something, and ran off in the direction of work.  It was only when I bumped into the glass front doors before they opened that I started to realise how drunk I was.  When the elevator arrived at my floor, and I bumped into both sides of the hallway before making it to the door, I knew I was in trouble.  That hallway was only 20 feet long.  But it didn’t matter.  My wallet hit the card reader.  I’d made it.  

Habit’s a funny thing.  You get so used to the noises, clicks, beeps and responses that you realise something’s wrong in an instant.  

There was no response from the card reader.  An error, surely?  Interference, something new in my wallet?  I dug the card out, throwing my wallet on the ground and badged it on its own.  Nothing.  Not an ‘Access Denied’ six beeps, or a ‘Card Format Unrecognised’ five beeps.  Nothing.  The lights were on, but no-one was home.  A few feet away, the keypad for the alarm was lit up like a headlight convention.  All the lights were on, the screen totally blacked out.  No beeps for keypresses.  Just .. nothing.  

The blood drained from my face.  The route servers were inside, suffering some unknown fate, our customers probably getting more furious by the minute, and I /could not open the door/.  AGAIN.  No, sod it.  I wasn’t taking any more of this security system’s crap.  I was getting into this datacentre, security system be damned.  

You all know what I’d tried before, and I knew as well, so I didn’t bother trying again.  My tools, once again, were behind the locked door, and then the light went on over my head.  

> Chhopsky: I can’t .. go through the door … I can’t .. go AROUND the door .. I can’t go .. UNDER it …. but can I go OVER it!?  

This is the logic of a drunk engineer; try all the dimensions!  There was a chair that we left outside for people working outside the DC, so in my infinite wisdom, I dragged the chair over to the wall, and lifted a ceiling tile.  Unlike the DC, where the ceiling tiles were weighed down with hundreds of heavy cables, the office was free and clear.  And the wall itself stopped at the ceiling.  So, pushing the tile into the cavity between the suspended ceiling and the concrete, I hoisted myself up into the ceiling.  

This did not work as well as I’d hoped because I was not very strong.  I kicked and pushed off the wall, scrambling to push myself up onto what I now realised was a very thin wall.  For those not familiar with a suspended ceiling, metal rods are drilled into the concrete block above, and a grid pattern hangs below it.  Inside those grids are weak, light tiles basically made of a combination of cardboard and plaster.  Looking at the predicament I’d gotten myself into, it became apparent that the only things that were going to support my weight up here were the tie-rods into the concrete.  So I’d hold onto the rods with my hands, and lying prone in the ceiling, distribute the rest of my weight along the horizontal connectors. I’d drop down onto the file cabinet at the far end of the room, about 15 feet away.  This plan was /flawless/.  

And it worked.  For about 6 of the required 15 feet, upon which point my hands slipped, and I fell through the centre of the ceiling tile, towards the floor below.  By some insane miracle, I landed mostly on my feet, scrambling ungracefully to regain balance, coughing up ceiling tile dust and god knows what else.  Probably asbestos.  

When the coughing stopped, I ran over to the security panel, pulled the power, and plugged it back in.  It beeped a single happy POST beep and hummed to life, making normal sounds instead of the endless buzzing it had been making before.  My access restored, I quickly found the problem - a circuit breaker had tripped, and due to a wiring error on the part of an electrician at some point, both route servers had been wired into the same circuit, rather than the different feeds on different UPS’s via different distribution boards that they were supposed to.  

With a dustpan and brush, I set about cleaning up the nightmare my dramatic entrance had caused.  It was not a small mess - ceiling tiles are about 5 feet by 2 feet, and this one had exploded.  It took about an hour.  After finally sweeping up all the mess, putting the ceiling tile I’d broken to get up there back together, and replacing the one I’d broken getting down, I walked my ass out the door, feeling smug that no-one would be the wiser for my ceiling entrance, and I’d have a grand story to tell.  

Monday morning rolled around and I was the last one in.  Aaron stared at me.  

> Aaron: What the hell did you do to my desk?  
> Chhopsky: ... wha?

I walked into the office, and stared in horror.  I don’t know what the hell I’d cleaned up but it looked someone had hit a bag of flour with a baseball bat.  It was /everywhere/.  How wasted was I?  What did I spend an hour cleaning?  And how in almighty crap did I diagnose an electrical circuit being miswired and split with no electrician tools of any kind?  

I have no idea.

But what I did know, was how to break in. So I documented the procedure, and added it to the Tech Support Wiki."
talesfromtechsupport,"This story is pretty much almost 5 years old, but I want to vent it out, it's been causing me grief and I just need it to share it to finally feel calm.


As you may remember, I live in Mexico and things are not exactly pretty, thankfully I know how to watch my back and don't make enemies, but sometimes, destiny catches up with you.


I had finished my training and got a certificate that allowed me to work on a Computer store and repair computers, arrived early, everything normal until 1PM, Guy comes in, wants his HDD wiped clean and a brand new copy of Windows 7.


I didn't ask many questions, just took it to the back and started working on it, gave the case a nice cleaning and removed the dust, boot it up, then manure hit the fan.


I hear from the front how the front glass breaks and people started yelling my boss and the man to get the f*ck down, as well lots of insults to the client, before I could react, someone comes to where I was, pointing an AK rifle variant at me, i jump to the floor, eating that dirt and holding my hands on the back of my neck, avoiding any eye contact

>$T: WHAT DID YOU DO TO THAT COMPUTER!?

>$Me: Nothing!!! I didn't get to touch it! I was just cleaning it!!!!

>$T: LIES CABRON!!!

>$Me: Check it yourself, everything is intact!

I could feel the barrel pointed agaitns me, I heard someone else come in and take the PC away, it felt like hours until they decided to retreat back and run away.

Once I recovered from the shock, i stand up and head to the front, my boss was on the phone, crying histerical, I didn't even hear the police syrens, then i noticed the client was missing.


I was not allowed to see the security footage, but the client was taken away, he was identified as a cartel member, body discovered hours later.


If it wasn't because I needed the money, i would have quit inmediatly, thakfully me avoiding eye contact probably saved my life.

talesfromtechsupport,"So this one goes back to '99 or so.  I was working in the corporate headquarters of a very large telco, responsible for the email system for HQ - about 1100 users at the time. Like all the sysadmins at HQ, I was a contractor, working through a bodyshop outsourcer. 

My boss was a guy I'll call S. S was the site manager for the outsourcer, and was the direct manager of all the contractor sysadmins.    

The customer contact was a guy I'll call J.   J was what they called an IT planner - basically a systems architect. He had dotted-line responsibility over all the sysadmins, including me.  

I also had a backup there, who I'll call B. B was a competent sysadmin, capable of handling most day to day stuff. 

We normally kept staff in the office from 8-6 on workdays, with an on-call rotation for certain specialty areas, including email.  Back then, we carried a pager (yes, an old school beeper) for oncall duty.   My oncall rotation was one week on, one week off.   This story happened in my ""off"" week, when B carried the pager.    

One saturday night, at around 3:30am, my home phone rang. My wife answered, and it was J calling.  She grumpily handed the phone to me.  Now my wife and I had just gotten home, having been out for much of the night with our neighbors. I was, for lack of a more refined term, positively hammered at this point.   

J informed me that there was an email outage, and that I needed to remote in and get it back up immediately, and then drive to the office to start a root cause analysis.  I informed him that I was in no condition to drive (let alone touch a production rig) and asked what B told him when he called the on-call pager.  J told me that he didn't call the oncall pager because this was way too serious of a problem to trust the backup sysadmin.  He wanted me working on this, and that if I can't be relied upon to do my job when I was needed, he'd find someone else who could, and hung up the phone.   I went back to sleep. 

The next morning I had an email from B, telling me that J had called him at home (rather than paging the oncall rotation.) It was a very simple issue - our backup software went screwy and started writing out hundreds of GB of temp files, which filled up a critical volume on our production email server.  Temp files deleted, email services restarted, problem kicked over to our backup software SME to figure out what happened.  Total downtime after B got the call was about 15 minutes.  

The next day, I arrived at the office to a note from S, my manager, asking me to come see him ASAP.  I went to S' office, and sitting there was J, who was in the process of demanding that I be fired immediately for ""being drunk at work.""  From there, the conversation went something like this: 

>S: But Blempglorf wasn't at work.  He was at home, and wasn't in the on-call rotation this weekend.  
>J: I don't want to hear it about the on-call rotation.  Blempglorf needs to be ready to work when I tell him to. I can't rely on an alcoholic, and I want him gone.  
>S: If he's not on call, he's free to do whatever he wants with his time.
>J: Not as long as he works for me.   

J then demands that I hand my office badge to him, and calls security from S' phone to have me escorted out of the building.  I'm in absolute disbelief at this point.  S gets up and goes off to points unknown, just as security arrives to see me out to the parking lot.  As I'm driving off, I see J's boss, I'll call her M.  M is running across the street to the parking lot.  Strange, but I was more focused on how the hell I was going to explain this to my wife when I got home. 

I got home, and my wife was sitting on the couch, just absolutely livid. Now this was REALLY weird, because I hadn't told her what happened yet. ""Those motherfuckers fired you!?!?!""   I'm confused as hell at this point.  My wife told me that M called her, and that I need to call her back as soon as possible.  Come to find out, when S had went off, he was going to M's office to explain the situation and keep him from shitcanning me.  M heard from S, and freaked the hell out.  When I saw her running across the street, she was trying to catch me in the parking lot before I left to tell me to come back in.  When M couldn't find my car, she went back into the office and called the house, intending to leave me a voicemail, but got my wife instead.  M told my wife what had happened, promised to rein J in, and asked her to tell me to come back into the office to sort it out. 

So I let them stew for a while.  M called about 20 minutes after I got home.   We let her go to the machine.  S called as well, just as my wife and I went out to get some lunch.  Over lunch, my wife and I talked about how we would handle this, and (largely for financial reasons) we decided to talk to them to see if we could work this out. We got back home to 3 more voicemails from M and S. About 30 seconds after we walked in the door, the phone rang again. This time it was J, obviously on speakerphone.  J apologized to me, and asked me to come back to work the next day. I agreed, but as he hung up, I could hear M say to him: 

>""J, you're a fucking idiot."" 

I worked there for another year after that, before another J fuckup made me leave once and for all.  That was a whole 'nother story.

talesfromtechsupport,"A few years ago, I worked at the IT helpdesk for $organization. We just had an influx of quite a few new users. We typically see a large spike in phishing attacks during hiring season, but this particular incident takes the cake.

It was a lazy Saturday morning, and I was lounging around with the rest of the weekend skeleton crew. There was talk of ordering a pizza and pulling the N64 out of the closet to play Mario Kart. My headset beeped with the sound of an incoming call, so I excused myself to my desk.

> TedTheViking: You've reached $organization IT, how may I assist you?

> New Hire: Yeah, hi, I just started this week, and I'm having trouble activating my account.

> TedTheViking: All right, I can take a look for you, could you give me your account ID please?

His account checked out. After verifying that he could sign in and send/receive emails, I reassured him that everything was fine, and he could contact us if he had any further problems. I rejoined my colleagues, who were digging around the tech closet for the N64's RCA cable.

A few minutes later, two phones rang within a few seconds of each other. It was rare to have more than one or two calls in an hour during the weekend. Maybe the web servers were down or something.

One of my colleagues frowned, then waved me over to his desk. He wordlessly indicated to his screen, which was displaying his work email account. In his inbox, there was the worst attempt at a phishing email that I had ever seen. It was mostly a pile of unintelligible gibberish, but contained a hyperlink, the word ""activate,"" and seemed to vaguely hint at account deletion.

My headset beeped with the sound of an incoming call. I let it roll through to the holding queue.

I asked everyone to pull up their inboxes. All of us had received the same email.

I half-jogged back to my station, copied the link from the email, then opened it in a Linux VM.

503 Service Unavailable.

I started laughing.

Our users are so gullible that their collective stupidity crashed a phishing server.

talesfromtechsupport,"This one is 2 weeks in the making. I was instructed to reduce spending in IT by X amount before the end of the year. The company as a whole need to cut 3m in spending by end of fiscal year because reasons. 

I was specifically handed a list of ""potentials"" as a recommendation to cut. 

First thing I did was collected all of those people and gave them 2 lists. The number of phone line accounts vs the number of employees, and the number of fax accounts that are inactive. 

For 2 weeks those men and women worked hard. They scoured AD, the horrible phone website, and verifying the fax accounts. 

They found over 12k phone accounts, that cost 22.95 each, that belong to termed users but are still active. 

We did the audit on the fax system by determining who has not received or sent a fax in 6 months. We found over 37k accounts incactive. OF those 9k had never logged in, 12k were termed users and nearly everyone else had set up their efax and never used it. The rest were people who rarely faxed as a backup. They wanted their accounts to stay. 

So 35.5k accounts at 19.50 each a month we were spending. 

So far we were at a little under 1m a month being spend on useless things. 

I started to go through Vendor programs A-G looking for similar instances. These included programs like snipping tool like program, password manager, a couple of CRM programs, and a stock program that a couple hundred employees literally never used. 

After that was done, I worked with the server dudes for 2 days getting these accounts directly associated with our AD accounts. Every single user now has creds associated with AD. 

Now when a user is listed as term for 7 days, it terminates said accounts at the end of current billing cycle. 

As a side effect, I just accidentally an SSO. 

All in all I saved the company over 2m a month.

Today came with the promise of an all corp supervisor meeting and the BS that that entails. 

It would take too much time to list out which department is with whos character so all lines will begin with > $Sales or > $HR. 

> $CEO - I am very glad all of you are here. As you know end of fiscal year is approaching and we must trim the fat, so to speak, for year end financials and the IRS. 

HE goes on like this for 20 minutes and then has everyone go around the table. We arent supposed to say things like. ""We terminated X number of users."" But instead say things like. ""We reduced salary cost by X percent.""

> $Accounting - Our department was able to reduce financial responsibility, in particular salary, by 12 percent saving the company 80k a year. 

> $CEO - OK very good. Marketing?

> $Marketing - We reduced financial responsibility but 45 percent. However only one percent of that was salary. The rest was from programs we had used in the past but had stopped using. We were still paying for them though. 

> $ME - Which programs were those so I can mark them down?

> $Marketing. - *Windows GFX Programs they stopped using when they switch to mac.* Plus a stock program from when *former head of marketing* Ran the place. 

She mentioned the stock program I had removed. The one we were paying for in IT. Not marketing. I let it slide. 

> $ME - If anyone else has terminated a program let me know please and I will take care of anything that needs to be taken care of on my end. 

Two more department tried to claim credit for my auditing work. When it finally came to my time though. 

> $CEO - Well we are just about out of time IT I am sorry bu...

> $ME - $CEO I am sorry to interrupt but there is information in my report which is not only vital to this meeting, but will have major implications on everyone in this room and the company. 

> $CEO - Ok. Proceed. 

> $ME - As supervisor over the IT support area I have increased the salary responsibility by 20 percent as a way to save money. 

> $HR - Come again?

> $ME - Using the list of suggested layoffs from HR, I gathered those exact people for a team to audit all cost incurring systems that are utilized by *our company* IT. 

> $Accounting - How does more employees save 

> $ME - *interrupting him* Using this audit, we have determined that there are over 100k accounts belonging to various programs, services, and paid software. These accounts either belonged to termed employees, people who did not even know they had the account, people who did not use the accounts ever, or people who simply changed computer systems. 

> In fact *Vendor system* A, B, and C were not being paid for by Marketing, Accounting, and Sales respectively. Those costs were incurred by IT. (I hand out the leaflets showing the money came form IT budget. 

> $CIO - So what does all of this mean. 

> $ME - We have tied every single vendor account, cost incurring service, and basically every single system that we pay per employee to that employee's AD account. This effectively creates an SSO for our users.  ON top of that it creates the immediate savings of 2.3 million with accounts terminated for terminated users, accounts terminated that were literally never used, and account terminated for programs discarded. 

> $CEO - *Whistles.* 2.3 million. That is what I like to hear. 

> $ME - A month. 

Yes I dramatically revealed that 2.3 million was not annual, it was monthly. 

> $CEO - So let me get this straight. We all here as a company have been wasting 24m a year on things no one used, terminated employees, and discarded programs?

> $ME - Yes. However with the addition of tying all accounts to the  AD credentials, we have effectively stopped this from happening in the future. 

> $CIO - Why was this allowed to happen?

> $ME - Your predecessor created this storm and we, as a company, inherited it. I never had the urge to look into these issues as they are not directly IT related issues. I just refuse to fire my guys for no reason other than to save money. No IT employees are lost in this. In fact we gained 2. These two are part of a team in charge of all vendor accounts. They will approve, deny, create, change, and manage all vendor accounts. 

> $HR - What will this team be called. 

> $ME - Umm Vendor Accounts?

> $CEO - I am still hung up on these accounts. How is it that they were allowed to accumulate like that?

> $ME - The Former CIO set up these accounts for other departments but set the cost to go to IT. No one looked into it for IT because why would we? These are not IT programs. They are *our company* programs. IF you want to blame someone, blame the former CIO. No one in the room knew some of these accounts existed until I had the urge to look them up. 

Long pause. 

> $Me - Look at it this way. Now we have an extra 24+m to spend on expansion of the company. "
talesfromtechsupport,"As some of you will know, I work an out of hours service desk which provides general IT support to a few different businesses out of hours when their normal IT people have gone home. These businesses are often hundreds of miles away and my access to their internal systems is usually anywhere from extremely limited to none existent.

This is a gem of a call that I received and typical of the level of stupidity we have to deal with.

**Me:** I'm sorry, you're calling the IT emergency line, I can't open a door for you I'm based in <miles away>

talesfromtechsupport,"Hey TFTS. LTL;FTP.


Like most of you here, I too have parents whom are largely tech-illiterate. but over the last two years, I've been making a conscious effort to get my parents (especially mum) to understand computers better. 


I'm a big believer of the ol' *give a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day, teach him how to fish, and he can have food for life* mentality. So rather than showing mum how to resolve her every problem, we go through a process of:


* *what do you think is wrong?* 
* and *how are you going to solve it?*



Now admittedly, things do get incredibly frustrating in this process, and it can often take ~1/2 hour up to 1 hour to resolve issues. **BUT**, it has slowly been working.



So today, mum came to me with a problem, and as usual, seemed to blow it way out of proportion.



> $mum: My phone is broken.

> $me: What do you mean?

> $mum: The camera doesn't work.

> $me: What do you mean exactly?

> $mum: When I go to the camera app, it says *connection cannot be establised*

> $me: So have you tried anything to resolve it? (*insert smirky face*)

> $mum: I turned it off and on again. But that didn't work.. 

> $me: uh huh.

> $mum: So then I booted the phone into recovery mode. 

> $me: (*cue disbelief*)

> $mum: And then I wiped the cache partition.

> $me: (*sustained disbelief*)

> $mum: But when I rebooted the phone, it still didn't work. So I thought the problem might be larger than that. 

> $me: ... 

> $mum: So I went onto several forums, and a lot of other people describing similar problems said it turned out to be a hardware fault.

> $me: How the hell did you know how to do that? 

> $mum: I googled it. 

> $me: (*cue jaw drop*) So..I guess your phone is broken.

> $mum: Yeah. That's what I told you in the beginning.



This is the same person whom two years ago didn't even know how to use the volume buttons on her phone - now troubleshooting all on her own... 


Mum, I am so proud of you. You've now been granted admin privileges."
talesfromtechsupport,"I owned a computer shop. We donated to a local county nature center by installing a network in the campus, which consisted of several one-story buildings elevated a few feet above the ground on pilings. We ran the cables and installed the network drops (RJ ports) in the required locations, and installed and configured the routers. We have learned that it never works to give things for absolutely free because then there is no end to what people will ask for, so we asked them to pay the wholesale cost of the cable… that’s it. Everything else, including labor, was free.

About a year later they started having random ports go intermittently bad, and the problem seemed to be getting worse. They asked us to troubleshoot.  We went out, found the problem was that rodents had bitten into some cables in multiple locations. Sometimes but not always this severed one of the wires at the point of the bite. If the severed wire touched even after being severed, the connection would work, sometimes. 

This intermittent fault took several hours to figure out. Since they had not actually bitten chunks out of the cables, just bitten into it, the cable appeared undamaged visually. The way we found the problem was to run a hand down the cable looking for a kink or something and feeling the little nick. Close examination showed the bite. Once we knew the problem, it required rewiring a few runs and telling them they had a bad mouse problem, get an exterminator. 

The diagnosis and repairs took 16 man-hours on-site (two people, all day). For this we charged only for our actual cost of the replacement wire itself.

About 30 days later I get a call from the county accounts payable.  

AP: “We have found conclusive evidence of fraudulent billing on invoice (the bill for the network diagnosis and repair) from your company. Since the amount is under $100 and this is the first instance of a problem from you, if you agree with the assessment and promise never to do this again, we will ban you from doing business with the county for one year. If you agree, we will send paperwork to that effect.”

Me: “(!!) No way will I agree to that. This was a donation of our time, and we only charged for the wire so it wasn’t a freebie. We did nothing wrong. Why do you think we did?”

AP: “We ran the diagnosis and bill by our IT department as a random check. They said there was no possible way your explanation of what was wrong and what you did to fix it could be true. You can dispute this, and we will have a hearing. But if we do this and it goes against you, you can be permanently banned from doing business and may even face charges of fraud.”

Me: “I want the hearing.”

(At the hearing, before a county board of something or other)

AP to IT guy. “Look at this invoice. Do you remember us asking your opinion of this? What was that opinion.”

ITGuy: “Yes. It said the network was losing connectivity to specific drops, and the problem was due to a bad mouse. I said there was no way a bad mouse would have that effect, especially on other computers on other ports.”

CouncilGuy to me: “Do you disagree with this? Can you explain how a bad mouse could do that?”

Me: “Yes. It bites the wires.”

ITGuy: “…What?”

Me: “Look at the invoice. It does not say ""a computer had a defective mouse."" It says there was ""a bad mouse problem."" Rodents. Bit. The. Wires. We installed new wires. We donated our labor to do so, and provided the wire at cost.”

ITGuy: “That… does make sense.”

AP: “Well, OK. We’ll drop this one. But we’re going to be watching you!”

talesfromtechsupport,"I received a ticket from a company we provide IT infrastructure and support to. The company is a marketing company with specific requirements and budget so there was no going away from tower PCs. One day I received a ticket from their department manager asking me to remove the ugly boxes as they don't need them.

I decided to call and explain about the boxes...

Me | DM: Department Manager | DM's Boss

Me (On the Phone): Hello IT Support, Me speaking

DM: O good you're calling to arrange collection, I would like the boxes collected in precisely one hour as we are going to a conference later.

*We were talking about disconnecting about 40 PCs!*

Me: No, I'm not calling to schedule a meeting but to explain that if we remove these boxes you won't be able to use the computers

DM: Do you think I'm Stupid?

Me: No, I'm just explaining that you won't be able to use your computer without the computer being connected to the screen

DM: What are you talking about? I don't look under my table to use the computer. Look you obviously don't know what you're talking about, I want to talk to someone who knows about IT. O I also want your first name and surname so that I can make a complaint!

Me:  My name is Me, I'm not giving you my surname for data protection and I do know what I'm talking about. Trust me, if you remove the actual computer, the box you are referring to you won't be able to use the computer.

DM: Watch the Space! *Slams the phone down!*

*I closed the job documenting everything. A week's gone by and we get an Emergency call-out, stating that none of their computers are working. We arrived to find all the computer towers have been cut free from their cages and removed.*

Me: What happened to all the towers?

DM: I told you to watch the space, I got a professional team to remove the boxes! See it is possible!

Me: No I don't see, now you can't use the computers!

DM: What a lot of nonsense, just get the internet working so that we can use the computers again!

Me: No, what happened to the computers?

DM: Are you stupid or something? They're here! *referring to the monitors*

Me: Ok, ok what happened to the boxes?

DM: They took them to the skip

Me: Right you are telling me that you threw away leased computers which are worth £1300 each? I want to speak to your boss Now!

DM: He's in a meeting

Me: Get him now! This is very serious

DM: Ok

DM's Boss: First you refuse to do your job and now you pull me out of a meeting? Where are all the computers by the way?

Me: DM threw them away and we need to get them back now as they had sensitive data on them.

DM's Boss: Where are the computers?

DM: You mean the boxes?

DM's Boss: YES!!!

DM: they are heading to the skip

We drove to the skip but there was no record of these computers being brought in. Two weeks later the company suffered data breach which along with the damage bill caused the company to go into administration

&#x200B;

Edit:

It was escalated, I didn't write much about what happened because the entire situation was dealt with by my bosses boss who wasn't providing much information, I'm told that DM was arrested and that all computers were retrieved by the Police, but that's where my knowledge ends."
talesfromtechsupport,"So, to give you some context - I was a student back then and during summer I've managed to get internship as IT Admin. The work was quite nice, I was doing helpdesk stuff but also things with servers and was involved in SAP deployment. Anyway - support of users was one my tasks.
Company was from automotive sector - airbags/seatbelts etc. and I was working in production plant connected with offices so I had to support both facilities.
One time I get a call - that was unusual, as we always reminded users to write tickets, which were responded in real-time so it took max. 10 minutes before I contacted incident submitter. 
Call was more or less like:


- ""For f**** sake what are you doing with the scanners, whole line has stopped and we are completely blocked now, we can't do anything without them, they're not working and showing errors, <here just put some more f-words from 50 year old lady, production leader, who looked a lot like Shrek after a car accident>""
The line was about 10 min. walk from my office so I stayed on the phone while I was walking there.
- ""Ok, tell me what is going on, calm down.""
- ""YOU ARE MESSING WITH THE SYSTEMS AGAIN, YOU SHOULD ALL BE FIRED GOD DAMMIT, I AM WRITING TO YOUR MANAGER AS SOON AS IT WILL BE FIXED""
- ""Please calm down, we were not doing anything with this since January (it was August).""
- ""YEAH SURE, YOU NEVER ADMIT TO  A F$%@-UP""


At this point I was already thinking about different ways of cutting her throat open, but still played it cool. 
I finally arrive at the line and ask her to hand me a scanner. All people from production line were standing there with crossed shoulders and looked at me like ""Here you go, you messed up so fix it huh"" and the leader said something like ""Oh here you are, now make it work after you f***ed up"".


Basically, the scanner was just something like a Windows PDA with scanning module.
Nothing fancy. All she had to do was to power it up, type username/password and it was ready to go, it was all about scanning the bar codes of airbag parts.


So I take the scanner and look at the screen.
Back at her.
Back at the screen.


- ""Were you asked to change password recently?""
- ""YES, WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR SUCH BULLS**T""
- ""Because the screen says that you have typed wrong password 5 times and you are always reminded that after this the scanner blocks for 20 minutes. And by the way you have 3 backup scanners so why you didn't use them? You messed up, not me. And it's not ok to talk like that to any employee of the company, so I will surely report it to YOUR manager - we have call recording enabled on our mobiles (we didn't, but she could never know).""
- ""Ugh... ummm, emmm.""
- ""Yea, bye.""

I told the story to her manager, she apologized officially the whole IT team, brought some cheapest cookies from the store and basically pretended to be sorry. Still IT was the most hated group in the company - but I guess that's the way things are.


EDIT: Lol, I expected a 100 upvotes at most, but I see it exploded a bit over my expectations, and it's not even the best of my stories :D"
talesfromtechsupport,"Here I am, another calm morning before the storm. I sip away at my Dr. Pepper and take a bite of donut. The queue is clear and the emails are quiet. Then, as is to be expected, the phone rang. I clear my throat and pickup the receiver with a cheerful ""Hello this is (me) how can I help you?"" 

""Good morning, my computer won't connect to the internet.""

We run through some basic troubleshooting, have you restarted the computer, is the cable plugged in, are the dummy lights on, is your computer turned on. Still nothing so I resign myself to a brisk walk down the hall to see what's going on. 

As I enter the room I begin double checking everything we talked about over the phone. The cable is plugged into the computer, the indicator lights are on, but they keep flickering out for a second. Seeing this I begin tracing the cable back to where it's plugged in. This room is setup terribly by the way so the Ethernet cable is run around the room so the person can have their desk where they want it. 

As I trace the cord I find out that it goes through a closet (not a network closet but a closet closet) and then out the other side and into the wall jack. I go to check the connection and notice the cable is tight, really tight, like I can't move it an inch tight. The effects of my Dr. Pepper start to take effect and the connections are forming. I open up the closet and find the culprit. There are coats hanging from the Ethernet cable. We're talking big, heavy coats. The poor cable was under so much strain that it was being ripped apart. I quickly removed the coats, making an internal joke about getting a load balancer for all the traffic on this line, and then made the person aware that Ethernet does not make for a good coat rack. 

Once the weight was removed everything started working again and I was off to finish my breakfast."
talesfromtechsupport,"Since the day I started at this small company I noticed their workstations were horribly out of date and reaching end of life for support and depreciation. I worked with a developer to get our in-house software to run on new machines with much more CPU+GPU to run everything. This was only in an effort to prevent or avoid being backed into obsolescence, but the development team saw an opportunity to optimize the application.

Fast forward about a year when the project is complete and the application can now finish its processing in 10-40x less time depending on difficulty. We have everyone on new systems that run like a dream and everyone is thrilled with how much more we can do in a day. The department head sends a wonderful email about the new time it takes to process.

The backlog of work is now quickly shrinking for this team and their department head has to stop calling in per-diem workers. Slowly, we fire employees as there's not enough work for them.

Fast forward another year and we've fired some 20 people (about 27% of our company). I was friends with many of them.

I still feel bad 5 years later."
talesfromtechsupport,"As some of you may know, I work an out of hours service desk supporting multiple businesses. This particular business is an educational institute and this particular discussion took place between myself and a student;

**Me:** Yes we've established you can't print- what actually happens? what errors are received? What does the printer do?

**Caller:** It tells me to top up my print credit as I have a negative balance of -$49 

**Me:**...

**Caller:** *HELLO!*

**Me:** I'm sorry, I don't see the issue here. You'll need to clear the $49 outstanding balance before you can print

**Caller:** But I don't owe you any money!

**Me:** Okay, are you saying this balance has been added to your account in error?

**Caller:** No

**Me:** Can you please explain what you mean?

**Caller:** I was photocopying loads of personal pictures yesterday and since then I have this balance. But I don't think I owe this as I didn't get any warnings when photocopying

**Me:**... But you're aware there's a charge for photocopying?

**Caller:** YES OF COURSE I AM!

**Me:** Okay, so I don't see why you're disputing the balance? You used a photocopier for a large job and as a result of this have a negative balance which will need to be cleared - regardless of ""warnings"" or not, you still used a service at the end of the day and need to pay for what you've used - you've just admitted you knew about the charge before using the service.

**Caller:** I JUST NEED TO PRINT NOW!

**Me:** Okay, you'll need to clear the balance on the account first by topping up

**Caller:** BUT THIS IS URGENT!

**Me:** It's 11 pm - I'm not sure what you're asking me to do. If you want to print you'll need to clear this balance by topping up your credit 

**Caller:** BUT I DON'T OWE YOU ANY MONEY!

**Me:** You said you used the photocopiers?

**Caller:** YES

**Me:** Presumably you have the documents you photocopied?

**Caller:** YES

**Me:** So you have photocopied documents that you haven't paid for. The photocopiers should not be used for personal use either. What is it that you need to ""urgently"" print right now?

**Caller:** I want to print a banner for a party

**Me:** So, again you're using the printing facilities for personal reasons - in clear breach of the policy you agreed to. You've also called an IT emergency line and claimed this was ""urgent"".

**Caller:** WELL I DIDN'T GET ANY WARNINGS!

**Me:** Thanks for calling. I'll report this to your school office for further investigation but I'm unable to deal with this on the emergency line. Goodbye *click*

talesfromtechsupport,"I'm a Network and Server Administrator at a hospital, but I occasionally field help desk calls as well. So, one day I'm slow so I'm helping answer some calls when one of our Switchboard Operators calls. 

Me: IT. 


Operator: Hey, I have a problem. 


Me: OK, what's up?


Operator: I've been playing Candy Crush on my phone and it keeps messing up. 


Me: What do you mean? Is your phone disconnecting from WiFi?


Operator: No, I just can't seem to beat this level no matter what I try. 


Me: *trying not to laugh* Uhhh, I'm not familiar with that application. Each department is supposed to have a Super User for their applications which handles tech support between the users and the vendor. Have you engaged your Super User?


Operator: *getting pissed* No, smart ass, I didn't. 


Me: *Holding back laughter as well as Jimmy Fallon on SNL* I'm sorry you're upset ma'am, but all I'm doing is trying to help you by getting you to the most appropriate channel for support of your issue. 


Operator: I thought that you may have played this game before and that you may be able to help. 


Me: No ma'am, Candy Crush isn't an application that the IT department uses or supports. 


This was the most humorous call I've gotten. What made it so funny is that the user was getting so mad that I couldn't help her and that I was laughing at her. I mean, come one.

talesfromtechsupport,"Hello everyone, first time poster on this sub but I can assure you it won't be my last. Please enjoy today's pickings.

I had a person come up and say that they have been transferring some files for hours and it's only at 61%.

I have a look and find that they are not transferring files at all.

All they've done is plug their video camera in to the computer and the 61% is the level of battery remaining on the device.

The person has been watching the battery drain for hours."
talesfromtechsupport,"I used to work at a small structural engineering firm (~10 engineers) as a project engineer, so I used to deal with client inquiries about our projects once we had released the blueprints for the construction of the project. Most of the time we did house projects that never presented a challenge for the construction engineer so most inquiries were about not finding stuff in the blueprints (if you have seen an structural blueprint you would know that space is a valued commodity so being a tetris player is a good drafter skill).

Then this call happened. I introduce to you the cast of this tale:

$Me: Your friendly structural engineer.
$BB:Big Boss, the chief engineer of the company and my direct superior (gotta love small companies).
$ICE: Incompetent Construction Engineer.

So one day we received a request to do the structural design for some houses that were meant to be on a suburban development, basically the same house with little differences built a hundred times. In that type of projects every dollar saved can snowball pretty fast so we tend to do extra optimization that on normal projects might be overkill, so some of the solutions we do are outside what most construction engineers are used to. That was the case for this project.

>$ICE: One of the beams you designed is collapsing. 

>$Me: EH ARE YOU CERTAIN?. Can we schedule a visit so I can go take a look before we start calling our lawyers?

>$ICE: Sure, but I'm telling you we followed your instructions to the letter, so I'm confident it was your design that was deficient.

Before going to the field $BB and I decided to do a deep review of the project, we rechecked the blueprints, ran the models again, even rechecked the calculations by hand, we found no obvious mistakes on our part so we started getting on a battle mood to shift the fault to the construction company (#1 rule of structural engineering conflict solution: It's always the contractors fault). So we put our battle outfit (visibility jacket, helmet and steel tipped boots) and went to see the problem.

>$ICE: See, the beam is collapsing! We had to scaffold it because it kept deflecting more and more!.

Effectively, we could SEE the beam getting deflected at simple sight, and that shouldn't be happening. We asked $ICE for a set of blueprints and started checking. Then we saw the problem... a column that we had considered and that was central to the design was nowhere to be found neither on the blueprints $ICE gave us or the real thing. Keep in mind that it had no *apparent* reason to exist because it functioned different than the usual designs.

$BB: Hey $Me,it appears we fucked up. The blueprints that we sent them don't seem to have THAT column, I better start calling the lawyer and insurance cause it appears to be our fault.

I was not entirely convinced, remember I had just reviewed the project so i was confident that column was on the final blueprints, we usually delivered a set of signed and sealed blueprints and a digital PDF version so they could make copies and give them to their people more easily. So i asked $ICE for the sealed blueprints... and  surprise the column was there. I was free to breath again, rule #1 was not bypassed. Now it was a matter of knowing WHO fucked up.

>$Me: $ICE, the blueprints you gave us are inconsistent to the ones we sent. Did anyone modify them?

>$ICE: Oh, sure I did. You put a column there that was too expensive and was doing nothing, I asked one of our engineers if we needed it for some code compliance reason and he said that if it was not structural it had no reason to be, so i deleted it on our working version of the plans.

That was all we needed to hear, we just went to his boss, told him he had modified the blueprints without our say so and that we were not liable for the failure. That day there was one construction engineer job opening and some happy workers got extra pay by rebuilding that part of the house.

TLDR: If an structural engineer says something is needed, then you better believe it is. Oh, and its always the contractors fault. I'm so happy to work in an industry where ""The client is always right"" doesn't apply.

talesfromtechsupport,"Come while it's fresh! I just hung up literally moments ago!

About fifteen years ago, I was a bright-eyed coder still in college. My family was poor. Thankfully so was my country about people experienced in coding so I often did some freelance jobs to afford a living in my college city.

One of the companies I coded for was one dedicated to importing metal, cutting it based on the customer's preferences and selling it. I doubt we need to know the details, but I had coded them a simple local network program automating the preferences of the supervisors in the office and supervisors in the workshop then storing the data in their accounting program.

Today about 10am, I received a call from their boss.

> **Boss** Hwaa, hello. We need you here in <city> urgently. Your program stopped working.

> **Me** Excuse me? I do not recognize the number you're calling from. Which program of mine?

> **Boss** Don't you? I am <boss's name>.. I'm speaking about the program you made for <company>.

> **Me** Oh.. The one I made in 2000? You're still using it?

> **Boss** 2001.. Yes we are. But today in the morning the program stopped working.

Oh, nostalgia... Anyway. I decided to troubleshoot quickly, learning about the details. Thankfully I have archives for all my codes, even my first ever program coded in GWBasic.

Of course, even coded 15 years ago, a program doesn't suddenly stop working in a day. I try to find out what has changed. Nothing seems to have changed since yesterday. Maybe a blackout? No. Changes in network? Nope. Changes in any hardware? None...

It will indeed take time.

> **Me** All right, <boss>.. I guess I can't solve it from afar. I seriously doubt it's a problem in my code but just in case, I will provide you the source codes. It's possibly a simple problem in hardware and you wouldn't want to pay me for that. A local tech will do it for much less.

> **Boss** Pay you? Why should we pay you? It's your program. Fix it.

> **Me** *(after a hearty laugh)* It's a freelance job I did for you literally fifteen years ago. As you're the witness, it had worked well until this morning. Even if it was the product of a giant company, the support would have been dropped already. Think about it, Microsoft has dropped support for XP. You can't expect me to offer free support.

> **Boss** We still want you to fix it. How much would you charge?

> **Me** I'm working for another company already. First I'll have to ask for unpaid vacation. Then I'll bill all my expenses to you in addition to <rate> per day. I doubt it'll take more than a single day, though.

> **Boss** It's too much.

> **Me** I know. That's why I urge you to find a local tech and have him have a look. If it's proven that the problem is my code, I'll happily send you the source codes and then you may have it updated to your heart's content.

> **Boss** I don't understand why the passage of time should change it. It's your program. You should fix it.

> **Me** It doesn't work like that. Anyway, I'll be awaiting your call from this number. Also my mail is <mail>.

He hung up, still muttering about how it's my program and I should fix it for free.

I'm dreaming about the future now. I wonder if I'll receive a call in 20 years, telling about a faulty program of mine I coded in 2003?

**UPDATE:**

I... didn't know people will be that much interested in my story...

There are too many comments asking about the same stuff and I'm.... lazy.. Forgive me.

I got my first phone number in '99. Never changed it. The company would find me anyway, I have social media accounts with photos of mine, my name's common but surname's rather unique, my father still lives in that city and he's pretty well-known anyway..

The program was written with C#, .NET 2.0, but no, updates in .NET Framework didn't cause it, .NET Framework and the newer ones always support 2.0 without installing anything. Yes I know it's doesn't work the same with 3.5 but please be my guest and try, make a very simple 2.0 application and run it in a brand new Windows 8 computer, it'll work.

Yeah they used to use Win98 then and .NET Framework had to be installed. But if I remember correctly it was a simple 20mb file. I knew only Delphi and C# to easily make a windows application then and I've always hated Delphi with a passion.

The computers that couldn't connect to the system in question all had a horde of trojans, I suspect it was because of the cracked Need for Speed I saw in all of them. I don't know why but the computer refused to connect to anywhere local. I didn't care or investigate really, I decided I won't waste time cleaning everything, I made a factory reset, created user accounts without admin privileges and gave the admin password to the boss."

talesfromtechsupport,"After recovery from my stroke I was in desperate need of work. So desperate I took an overnight shift at an webhost for tech support. Most nights it was pretty calm and people that called on my shift were usually just looking for more help with their website than just trouble shooting, but night staff had the time and it helped break up the monotony of the shift. Occasionally I would get Gems like this.

&nbsp;

I get a call and the guy is frantic on the phone. After finally getting him to confirm his username and password I ask which website of his is down. I type the url into my web browser and surprise I get his website no issues. Next I VPN to my home computer and pull it up there no issue again this is where we get into basic PC troubleshooting (reminder this guy is losing $1K/Hr because his website is ""down"")

&nbsp;

It is at this point that we get into basic PC troubleshooting and the following transpired.


Me: okay are you using a MAC or PC


Cus: PC


Me: can you click on the start menu and type in CMD


Cus: I cannot the screen is black


Me: *deep breath* is there a light on the front of your monitor and or your tower


Cus: no


Me: *deeper breath* is the cable plugged into the back of the device, and can you trace that cable back to make sure it is plugged into the wall. If you have a power strip can you see if it is in the on position


Cus: *rustling* I think it is, but cannot quite tell


me: what do you mean you cannot tell?


cus: I can't tell it is dark


me: Dark?!? can you turn on a light


cus: i could get a flashlight, but there is no power


Me: *head desk* I assure you sir your website is up you can check it again when you have power back

&nbsp;

TL:DR; someone making ""~$1K/hr"" from his website was unable to tell the difference between him being out of power and his website being down...

talesfromtechsupport,"*In case you didn't see the edit on the other post, it was suggested I post a standalone update*

My boss spoke with upper management yesterday, and when I came into that office today (as I normally do on Wednesday), I was immediately escorted to the board room by two security guards. The President, CFO, Chairman of the Board, SlimeCo's lawyer, our IT firm's lawyer, and my boss were all at the table. I found out my boss had threatened to file a proper criminal suit as a result of T.H's behavior, on my behalf.

It was explained to my boss and I that T.H, while an obvious problem, is a high-earner for the company and they would not fire her. However, it was discovered through an internal investigation that she had, in fact, gotten the numbers of all of the techs out of the CFO's Blackberry. We don't know how she got into the Blackberry, but what we do know is that the CFO left his Blackberry unattended which is a serious security compromise and also a violation of the contract between the company and my IT firm. 

Some very strong words were exchanged between SlimeCo's officials and my boss. The lawyers agreed that it was, in fact, a serious breach of contract leaving any data available to unauthorized users, and it was made clear that the contract in place would be terminated at the end of the meeting.

It was later explained to me that, given the nature of the breach, we'd basically have an ""all hands on deck"" situation where every available tech would report to SlimeCo and start pulling servers, switches, and any other leased equipment. Estimated time of dismantlement was about two and a half hours. (There was also the phrase ""wood chipper for hard drives"" thrown in there. I don't know if this was literal or a figure of speech.)

For the next two hours I was not allowed to leave the room. My boss, his lawyer, and SlimeCo renegotiated the contract on the spot. A 36% price hike, increased security improvements, and a couple other things that went right over my head.

The lawyer then pointed out that I was still well within my rights to, and asked if I would be, seeking legal action. I asked what my options were. Before he even got it out of his mouth, SlimeCo started talking about a ""settlement"" to keep me from going any further.

Without going into too many specifics there, a check was cut (and immediately cashed because they ain't gonna play me for no fool), The.Harpy was put on an actual probation, my boss gave me the rest of the week off — billed to SlimeCo — so I can have an actual vacation, and I'm no longer going to do any service at SlimeCo. Not the outcome I expected, at all."
talesfromtechsupport,"This story took place about 6 years ago, and it was my second week into a new job with a web hosting company.

I'd taken a call from a customer - we'll call her Karen - about some problem with the hosting service she had with us.  I took a look and determined that whilst there was an issue, the fault lay with her CMS and wasn't anything we would fix.

Me:  ""I'm sorry Karen, the issue is to do with WordPress, and unfortunately we can't assist with fixing this.  However, I can send you some links which may help you fix it, or you can ask your developer to look into it further"".

Karen: ""That's not good enough! I'm paying you $10 a month and I expect you to fix problems like this, not tell me to go away and deal with it myself"".

Me: ""I'm sorry you feel that way, however that $10 pays for the server space.  We'll gladly help fix anything server side that's interfering with the proper operation of your site, but we're not responsible for the software itself.""

Karen: ""WE'LL IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIX IT JUST DELETE MY FUCKING ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW""

Me: ""Ok, I can do that, but it may be easier ---""

Karen: ""STOP ARGUING WITH ME DELETE MY ACCOUNT CLEARLY MY $10 A MONTH MEANS SHIT TO YOU GO ON HURRY UP AND TERMINATE MY ACCOUNT IF YOU DON'T VALUE ME AS A CUSTOMER""

Me: ""I can do that for you, before I do, I need to ask if you have a backup of your data, as once I process this it's gone for good""

Karen: ""NO JUST DELETE MY ACCOUNT NOW I EXPECT AN EMAIL TELLING ME IT'S DONE \*click\*""

She'd hung up, and I sat there wondering what to do.  I thought about sitting on it, but she was quite clear in her instructions: delete her account.  Karen had already run through the identity verification questions and had requested (demanded) a cancellation.  I took a backup of her account as insurance, and processed the termination.  I also created a ticket, with appropriate notes and emailing Karen to tell her that her termination request had been taken care of.

I went home not long after that, but the next day I came in to work and was immediately called in speak to manager.  It turned out that Karen was notorious for this shit - she'd demand we do things beyond our scope, and scream and cry and threaten until someone said ""Ok, we'll do it"".  She'd gotten used to other staff members doing whatever she demanded that she expected we bend over backwards.  If she ever heard the word ""no"" she'd threaten to cancel and go elsewhere.

It seemed that other reps had just fixed whatever problem in order to stop her tantrums and get rid of her.  I was the first in a long time to tell her no, and the only one who had ever followed through on actually terminating her account.

Manager: ""You're not in trouble, don't worry.  You did everything correctly.  I've had Karen on the phone all morning squawking about her website.  Oh, btw, did you happen to take a backup of her account?""

Me: ""Yep, it's on my computer""

Manager: ""Delete it and pretend it never existed""

And that's the story of how I destroyed Karen's business website."

> $ME = Me (You know its serious when I just list me as me)

> $DA = Double agent, our spy. 

> $SN = Snitch

> $WL = Wahoo lady in her final appearance. 

> $Rec = Contracting company recruiter. 

We are getting out of the realm of ancient history and into the realm of recent events now. Another post I made about this company recently helped set off the catalyst for the endgame. 

The time of our spies party was drawing closer and the information we needed was being collected. I was still getting the reports of the snitch not playing ball with our ticketing system. Cherry picking the best tickets, ending calls before confirming tickets were resolved, making people call back later in the day for non existent server issues, and simply just not doing his job. On top of this we started collecting his email logs between him and the sales manager who was his ""real"" boss. 

Yes. You read that correctly. He was using company email to communicate with the sales manager who put him up to it and when we found this out it was like Jebus himself placed the holy grail onto our desk and told us to drink it up beehotches. That's one. 

Once I had everything that I needed from my team I told them to return to normal in regards to the snitch. No longer needed anything else on that front so I let my team know to watch their backs and let them know to just continue working. Everything was being handled and we were in the endgame here. We had two termination level offenses. Three more to go. 

Seeing as the snitch figured he was above the law we had been collected his usage data in significant portions. This paid off really well in a way we did not expect. We expected him to use youtube when it was unblocked on the firewall, but it never came up in his history. It was strange because he had his headphones on quite a bit even when he was not on a call. Our server guys gave us the reason for that. Seems he had made his own website to get around our youtube monitoring. It was a simple white page with a single input. When you paste a youtube video's URL into the bar it plays the video in embedded mode. Since he was not going to youtube's website, it never raised any red flags. 

I walked over to the snitch and had a small conversation with him over it. 

> $ME - You aren't in trouble but there have been rumors that you have been on youtube. I do not care whether you were or were not there. I am just warning you that people are watching. IF you are caught on youtube you will be written up and walked out. 

> $SN - Sure thing man. Thanks for the heads up. 

> $ME - No problem. Keep up the good work. 

I had the server guys set up a redirect on our firewall to a section of our domain. The website it redirected to was a white website just like his, only instead of an input box it just had the text of. ""I warned you. Come to my desk now.""

It took two hours after the conversation and redirect were set up for him to come to me. I already had the write up ready and simply asked him to sign it. I told him to return to his desk and get back to work. 

This was three. 

The day of the party was the day of the second write up for the snitch. Our spy sent me a text message Saturday telling me to call him ASAP. 

> $Me - Whats up?

> $DA - You need to drug test snitch asap. 

> $ME - Details. I need lots of details. 

> $DA - He brought weed to my party and smoked it with a friend of his. 

I hung up with DA and called my boss. 

> $HIT - Its Saturday. What?

> $ME - Snitch smoked weed at spy's party. 

> $HIT - *Hilarious laughter over his side of the line.* You know what to do Monday then. 

We ended the call and prepared for Monday. We were not prepared for Monday. I informed the Wahoo Lady of the issue Monday but something broke with the citrix servers causing everyone's files to no longer show up. My role in that fiasco was handling angry calls and assuring people we had backups of everything and that the server team was locking it down. Wednesday of that week was the day that Wahoo Lady made her mistake and accidentally allowed access to our database to unauthorized users costing the company millions of dollars to fix it. I refer you to my post history here for that story. This put a hold on our plans as we had to clean up the mess from $WL but she did give me a nice going away present. 

In the other thread I mentioned my final words to her were just BS talking. This was a lie. We did have our nice exchange of goodbyes and I did give her a going away hug, but between those events she gave me a present. 

> $WL - I have a solution to your snitch problem. 

> $ME - How do you know about that?

> $WL - Contrary to the aloof misguided individual you write me as on reddit, I am very good at my job. Just like you have said in your posts. 

> $ME - I change a lot of details and embellish conversations in my post to protect identities, how do you know about my posts? (Which is Ironic because this conversation has almost no edits in it.)

> $WL - I am very good at my job. Was good at my job. 

She then opened her phone up and pulled up facebook and showed me the snitch's profile. 

> $WL - Take a look at his pictures. 

I scroll through and I see a lot of pictures of the sales manager in them. A large amount of pictures of the sales manager in them. 

> $ME - They are friends? So they hang out together. 

> $WL - Yes they hang out together, go to the movies together, eat lunch and dinner together, go to six flags together, golf together, adopt puppies together. Eat dinner one night and get breakfast the next day together. Dress up as Bert and Ernie on halloween together. 

The realization of what she was saying hit me and my eyes went wide. All kinds of scenarios went through my head but I could not bring myself to actually do them. I just sat in her chair and rubbed my temples.  

> $ME - I cant use this information. As much as I do not like them and as much as I just want to use this info to light the fire and watch it rise, I will not do that. I cant.

> $WL - You do not have to because I already did it. I shared this information with both the VP of IT and the VP of sales. 

> $ME - Why?

> $WL - I like you. I do not like him. (Sales manager) Also we have rules regarding disclosing relationships between employees and management.

> $ME - You know he is married right? This has the chance to ruin his marriage. 

> $WL - It will be handled quietly. But you need to get rid of the snitch on your own first before anything can happen. Upper management bows to this guys whims because he makes the money. But if you had a sure fire reason for the snitch to get fired then sales manager will lose his edge and likely his eyes and ears into your department. In the mean time I let the VPs know of the relationship but they do not know that he is snitching for the sales manager. 

Now it made sense how this guy got hired in the first place. Sales manager put in a good word for snitch and snitch got the job. Snitch did not actually become a snitch until January when sales manager did not get his promised promotion because they expanded the IT department threefold reducing the budget for his promotion and pay bump. In his warped mind the only solution was to fire off the IT people and free up the money. 

Armed with this new knowledge I left her former office feeling physically sick and got back to work fixing the major eff up she caused. Once things had stabilized, about a week later, I went to HR again and talked to the new head of HR. I let her know about the party and let her know about the weed and told her that I needed to have him drug tested asap. 

It turns out that a company wide drug test was actually already in the works in the form of entire offices being tested over the course of the month. So they just bumped up our office to be the next one tested. We do hair tests at our work so you can imagine the amount of people who just randomly decided to cut their hair after the email went out. 

A few days later the company we hired to do the drug tests showed up at our office to collect samples. We did not even wait for the results of the drug test before we started to act. We called his contracting company and told them we wanted to terminate his contract regardless of the results of the drug test but to wait for the results to come in. We had enough to fire him without the drugs, but those helped too. Funnily enough, sales manager decided it was a good time to go on vacation the day of the drug test and had been out since they cut the hair till the end of my post. 

It took a week but he came back positive for not just weed. Speed, heroin, and zanex and a few others. This was fireable offense 4,5,6,7,8,9 through goddamn 1000. HR got with us about the positive tests and informed them of our plan to drop him immediately at the beginning of the day that Monday. They set everything up and informed security of the plan. 

Monday morning security informed me of when his badge was activated on the door. I intercepted him at his desk and did not let him work. I asked him to come with me for a meeting and to keep up. I walked quickly to the meeting room and opened the door for him. On one side of the table were our head of HR, $HIT, a lawyer for the company, a lawyer for the contracting company, and various other managers from other departments who wanted to sit in and evaluate me. (I am being groomed for management in IT) Most of the other people were merely there to observe and said nothing.  

I asked him to sit down on the other side of the table and sat right across from him. Everyone stared at him for a second before my boss started talking. 

> $HIT - We are letting you go. 

> $SN - Why? (He responded really quickly in a surprised tone.)

> $HIT - Really? You have no clue why? (He was actually mad because he read through the emails and was about to go off on Snitch)

 I laid three files in front of him quickly not wanting $HIT to lose it and blow it for us. 

> $Me - This file here is your ticket logs. You cherry pick the tickets you want to work and then dump the calls when they turn out to be harder than you thought. *I pointed to the next one* Here is your internet usage proving that you bypassed monitoring to youtube without us knowing what you were doing. You then continued to use youtube even after I gave you a friendly warning. *Pointed to the third file.* And this one is the email logs with the sales manager proving your relationship to him and your plan to gut our department for his personal revenge. You have actively worked against us since the citrix project finished and we were transferred to the helpdesk. 

> $HIT - *Lays a paper in front of him.* And this is your drug test. You tested positive for 3 illegal substances, and 2 prescription substances. They also found chemicals consistent with over the counter body detox kits people think allow them to beat drug tests. I would ask you for the prescriptions for the two you tested positive for, but that is moot since the illegal drugs have already sealed the deal. 

> $me - There is a lot I want to say right now. You have no clue how badly I wanted to say these things, but given the circumstances it would be inappropriate. You were a good migration tech, but your quality as a worker deteriorated slowly. I can see why now. I recommend you get treatment for your addictions. I have lost friends for those same drugs and I do not want to see you in the papers one day. Your recruiter will give you some information for some free drug programs if you are interested. 

I motioned to the recruiter for his contracting company to come in and he was served his termination papers. 

> $REC - Here are your termination papers. Unfortunately since you tested positive for drugs we must also remove you from our recruitment lists. We wish you luck in your future endeavors and I personally hope you get the help you need for your addictions. 

His recruiter then handed him a pamphlet for a local, mostly, free drug program for getting people clean. 

The snitch sat there with the most defeated look on his face. He was breathing so heavily I thought he was having a heart attack. Security came in and asked for his badge snapping him out of his stupor. He was almost in tears as he handed his badge. We informed them of the BYOD status on his phone and he handed it to be wiped using the iPhone reset option. (NEVER do BYOD people. EVER.) It looked like he was going to say something during this entire process but he just used breathing techniques to keep himself calm. (I think they were breathing techniques at least.) He was then escorted out of the room. 

> $REC - I need to apologize to you for the trouble my employee caused you. 

Me and $Hit both told him not to worry about it. Legal and everyone else reviewed the case and all agreed we were pretty much in the clear on everything. (Substance abuse terminations require legal oversight to insure everything was handled properly.) The tapes for the meeting were pulled and sent to the VP of IT for review. 

I sent the email logs to both the VP of IT and the VP of sales. 

Once everything was said and done I sat down and started typing up this story. Yes I started typing up this story about an hour after we let the snitch go. Halfway through typing up part 4 the VP of sales called me and $HIT into his office. He wanted to apologize for the actions of the sales manager and informed us that they asked for his resignation. All parties agreed that him leaving quietly was for the best of everyone involved. The VP personally apologized to me and $HIT and said that this company was not in the policy of creating hostile work environments for its employees. He gave us his personal guarantee that if anything happened like this again, he would squash it personally. On a personal note he asked us to unblock Facebook so his employees can stop complaining. He said that no one actually cared about that rule before. It was only there to get rid of dead weight or to trim. 

We thanked him for that and  I went back to my desk to finish typing up this story. All websites were unblocked and everyone started listening to music on youtube again as well as watching sick game footage from *insert game here.* while they worked. 

 That is that people. We won the battle, the war, and got the VP to agree to our terms. I felt so relieved that the cancer of our team was gone. I can not say I was happy because of the way it happened, but I can say that I was satisfied with the outcome. Not good and not bad but acceptable. Normally when I have seen or had to let someone go I felt bad. But the only thing I felt from snitch was betrayal and pity. He used my trust and abused my good will and it hurt all the same. But it was a different kind of hurt this time. 

FRIDAY EDIT: Even today, five days after writing this, I feel bad for the guy and honestly hope he gets the help he needs. I just hope I never have to go through this again. Now please stop camping my user profile spamming F5"
talesfromtechsupport,"I do IT Hardware support for a college.  Coming in one morning I hear my phone ding for a new email as I am pulling in off the freeway.  I pull into the parking lot and pull out my phone to see the following email.

“Our department ordered fifty new laptops that just came in this morning.  We need IT to install the latest Windows on them along with the following software (and a long list of software follows).  These computers need to be ready to go by 10 AM tomorrow morning so we can use them for the first class.”

I check to see if this was forwarded by my Boss or his Boss.  Nope, it was sent directly to me.  No ticket, no purchase order information, I didn’t even remember seeing an order for new laptops in any department come through the system in the last month.  So I go to the office and show my Boss who reads the email and tells me that he never had a request for new laptops so he has no idea what it is about.  After a few minutes of trying to call the department with no answer I agree to walk over and see what this was about.

When I get to the Department Office I finally track down someone who knows what is going on and she leads me to one of the classrooms with a pile of boxes in the center of the room.  My heart just sinks.

There before me, a pile of new 7 inch Windows tablets with attaching keyboards sat.  I pick one up and look over the specs.  Low end tablets, barely enough memory to run Windows 10 (installed) but would never run Windows 7 (We haven’t upgraded the school yet, it was still a new OS) and is nowhere near able to run any of the software that they were requesting as each unit had about 16GB of storage.  

Needless to say, I was a little scared about this.  I asked her how these were even ordered through our system and she tells me that they by-passed the system and ordered from a web company to get a better deal.  I know that there was no reasoning with her so I ask if I could take one down to the office to get a look at it and she agrees with the stern comment of “These need to be ready by tomorrow!  Make sure it happens!”

Back at the office I show off their new toy to the rest of the staff and my Boss.  None of them are happy, there is no way we can install any software on these let alone connect them to our network so the students can log into them.  My Boss emails the Department Head asking why they didn’t go through IT to get the computers and she responds with the same answer I got earlier, they were cheaper this way.  He lets her know that we couldn’t fulfill the request and that they would be better off returning the computers and that we would work on getting them ones that would work with our network and software.  Well they can’t do that because the website had a no-return policy.  Not only that, but they hadn’t used a purchase order for it, they used the department credit card.  

So now we are stuck with fifty Windows 10 tablets that the department can’t really do anything with and the Department head is demanding answers as to why no one told her that we couldn’t use those.  For some reason they keep emailing me instead of talking to my Boss so I am getting the front end of the disaster here.  

We finally get to a work around.  The tablets are set up on the WiFi network and we have to create a generic user account for each tablet along the lines of “DepartmentTab01” and then link that user name to the MAC Address of the tablets so that no one would be able to log into the network with another computer.  They were delivered to the department a week later than they wanted.  

I wish it stopped there, but of course it wouldn’t.  

First day with the tablets a trouble ticket comes in saying none of the tablets would connect.  Get to the classroom and the teacher had written one of the user names on the board and was trying to have everyone connect to the WiFi with that one user name.  What is bad is that we had a printed set of login instructions hanging right by the board that she used.  

Then they wouldn’t charge.  Turns out the the tiny barrel plug that these things used had to pushed in all the way to get a connection.  Even just a little short of the mark and they wouldn’t charge.  None of the tablets had been plugged in properly over the course of about two weeks.  


And we still get random request for software to be installed on these.  The students won’t even use them because the keyboards are just too small to type on unless they have the hands of a seven year old.  

Why do departments do this to us?  I really wish we had a purchase system in place where all computer requests go through us.

talesfromtechsupport,"Players in this drama:  
$Me: me  
$BM: boss man  
$FBI: FBI agent


Some years ago, I get an offer for a side job. I nearly always have something going on the side, but it happened that I didn't right then. The guy who made the offer was a friend of an acquaintance. I didn't know anything about him and he lived about 4 hours from me. 

We spend some time talking online, and it seems like a good gig. Basically, it was writing some shipping/warehouse software. He wanted me to travel down to meet him, expenses paid. I agreed. 

When I got there, things seemed a little bit sketchy, but often people who are starting small businesses or running one-person businesses don't have much capital. So I didn't think too much about it. 

We met in a restaurant. He told me about the job...again. I patiently listen to nothing new, wondering why I had to travel for this. Then he tells me I need to come meet his client. That his client won't sign the contract until we meet. Okay, fair enough. I think his client want's to see if I'm capable. 

We go to the client's place of business. Right before we go in, this guy tells me not to worry about anything he might say. If I have any questions, ask him afterwards. 

So, he represents me to the client as an employee. Other than that, things are fine. I don't get to see any of the computer equipment (the sysadmin isn't there). I don't get to see any of the existing software (because we aren't building off the existing software). 

After we leave, I question the ""employee"" bit, and the guy says he doesn't want his client to know he's using contract labor. Well...okay. If you're just starting in business, you want to look bigger than you are. 

We get down to brass tacks, and the guy has a whole elaborate system set up for work production and payment. I think it's overly elaborate, but whatever. I'm not planning to cheat the guy, and if he's paranoid, that's his problem. 

He would front me some money, about a week's worth. Every day, I would upload the current source code to the cloud. He wanted to pay by the hour, so I would keep a time sheet of hours worked. 

(Personally, I think this is plain stupid. If I give a price for completed work, then I carry the extra time for mistakes. If he pays by the hour, then he carries the price for mistakes. But some people pay for work. Some people pay for the time your ass is in the chair.) 

Every two weeks, he would pay based on the time sheet hours. 

This works out fairly well until the first time he missed a paycheck. I notify him that I haven't received payment and I keep working. When I hit the one week mark (the amount of the initial advance), I keep working but I stop uploading the source code. 

I get a paycheck. 

I start uploading the source code again. 

Next time I send him a time sheet, I get a phone call. 

>$BM: You're cheating me! I can see it on your time sheet. There are three days here where you put down hours you didn't work.   
>$Me: What do you mean?   
>$BM: You didn't work these three days because I didn't send your paycheck. That's how you forced me to pay you when I didn't have the money.   
>$Me: I worked those hours. I just didn't upload the source.   
>$BM: From now on, you need to upload the source or I won't count those hours as work. But I'll go ahead and pay you this time, even though I don't believe you really worked those hours. 

My paycheck finally arrived a few days late, but without the days I supposedly ""didn't work"". 

I calculated where I was on hours worked vs. hours paid, taking into account the initial front money. It was good, so I kept working. When I reached the end of the paid hours, I stopped working, and stopped uploading. 

I get another phone call:

>$BM: Why are you not uploading source?  
>$Me: I've run out of money. You didn't send a complete paycheck last time. If you want me to keep working, you need to pay me.   
>$BM: You're cheating me! Do you think I'm made of money?  
>$Me: This is what we agreed. If you'd rather switch to a pay for work delivered, I can do that.   
>$BM: No! You'll cheat me out of more money. I can get some kid out of high school to do this for less than I'm paying you. If you don't start working again, you will lose the whole project.  
>$Me: Why don't you go find that high school kid? 

That was the end of that. Or so I thought.

About a month later, I get a frantic phone call.

>$BM: You have to fix this!  
>$Me: Fix what?  
>$BM: The client's computer system has been ~~hac~~compromised. Everything's gone!  
>$Me: Don't you have another employee now? The one that took my place?  
>$BM: But he's just a kid. He can't fix this!! Can't you at least give me some suggestions?  
>$Me: What exactly happened?  
>$BM: It's the sysadmin. He got fired. He took down the whole system.  
>$Me: Why did he get fired?  
>$BM: We didn't need him anymore. The system was up and running fine. After he left, he remoted in and erased all the operating systems.  
>$Me: Well, you've got backups. Reload everything.   
>$BM: We can't. The sysadmin got the job because he had unlicensed copies of all the operating systems we needed. He used those to set up the network. Now we can't reload without buying licenses.   
>$Me: ....

After I hung up, I had a good laugh, and realized that I'd dodged a bullet with that company. That was the end of that. Or so I thought. 

Early one Saturday morning, I'm sleeping in. Enjoying a well-earned day off. Phone rings. 

>$Me: Hello?  
>$FBI: This is Special Agent xxxx from the FBI. I need to ask you a few questions about this company.   
>$Me: I don't work for them anymore.   
>$FBI: It concerns the computers that were ~~ha~~compromised.   
>$Me: I wasn't employed there when that happened.  
>$FBI: Yes, but $BM got some advice from you at the time? He says you can confirm the incident.      
>$Me: He did call me. I talked to him for about 10 minutes.  
>$FBI: Good. I need to verify exactly what he told you about the damage done.  
>$Me: He told me the operating systems had been erased.   
>$FBI: Yes. Can you estimate how much monetary damage was done by erasing the operating systems?  
>$Me: Well, none. They didn't own the operating systems, so it's not like any property was damaged or stolen.  
>$FBI: They didn't own the operating systems?  
>$Me: That's what they told me. They were running unlicensed copies.   
>$FBI: He told you that??  
>$Me: Yes. He told me that the sysadmin, the person who ~~ha~~compromised the system, brought the operating systems with him. After they fired him, he took the operating systems back. But he said they were unlicensed, so I don't know that they legally belonged to the sysadmin.   
>$FBI: Thank you for your cooperation.   
"
talesfromtechsupport,"So this happened about a year or so ago. The lawsuits finally were settled so I am able to write about it now. Once again timing, spacing, and conversations are embellished for dramatic effect. I do this to make my stories enjoyable. Otherwise they would be boring af. 

A high earner at our company had one of her underlings call into it support with an issue. She was sending on behalf of, instead of sending as user for delegated access. 
 
The tech was told simply that inside citrix it sends on behalf of but outside it sends as...

Took the tech a little bit to put 2 and 2 together but he got to 4 in the end. The reason why it was working outside citrix was because the underling was logging into the high performers account, instead of adding the second mailbox. 

He dug a little deeper and discovered that all of her underlings were logging into her accounts everywhere. Not just outlook. So he wrote up a ticket and passed it along to me after being told that NO they would not change their ways. 

I picked it up and the first thing I did was run a lockout report. This was just so I could gauge how many devices were logging into her account. 42 (actual unembellished number)

Now picture it in your head. Your direct supervisor, the ones who actually do work, picking up the ticket and constantly moving as they check this tool or that tool. Then they just freeze. That was me that day. ""Fourty two devices? Holy sh.... Ok."" 

I call up the lady on the phone. 

> $me = Commander William Adama  
> $UU = Uppity user. Or Tammy 2

> $me - Hello this is $me with IT. I was calling about a situation I had been made aware of. Several people log into your account for the purposes of work correct?  
> $UU - Yes that is right. Because of our high volume we need to be able to quickly respond as me for all situations. This has come up before and I must say that I have fought hard to get this permission and will not let it go.  
> $Me - I need to know how many devices are currently logged into your credentials at this moment. It is a matter of extreme urgency.  
> $UU - Christ really? Hold one. 

*Intermission*

> $UU - 12 devices. 5 PCs including mine. Everyone's phones including mine, an Ipad I own, and the reception PC in the front foyer.  
> $ME - Only 12 devices? I am reading 37 devices at this current moment. Earlier it was at 42.  
> $UU - That is just not possible. The only ones who have my password are the current employees. I have you guys change it every time we get a new one or let one go.  
> $Me - How do we change it? Walk me through the entire process.  
> $UU - I call you guys and have you set it back to what it was before.  

*Long pause.*

> $UU - Hello?  
> $ME - Do you not see the issue here? Do you not see what you have done?  
> $UU - What do you mean?  
> $ME - I have your tickets pulled up here in the system. You have submitted several requests to us about disappearing loans in your system. You have directly asked us before if people could be stealing your loans. And right now you tell me you never change your password. You call in and tell us what you would like it changed to. Do you not see why this is happening?  
> $UU - When you change the password in our system it makes you put it back into all of the devices so it cant be that.  
> $Me - First off no it does not. Second off, even if it did all they would have to do is put the same freaking password back in anyways.  
> $UU - Oh...  
> $Me - Yeah your branch is down. I am locking all of your accounts for now and we have to get infosec involed. I am sorry but it is out of my hands.  

I get up from my desk, which was at the old building, and I walk into my boss's office who was in a meeting with the EVP of IT, the CIO, and the accounts team supervisor. 

""Oh good. You are all here.""

This was how I interrupted their meeting to relay the information. In the movies, no one ever really truly captures the look of horror that slowly creeps into the faces of those who come upon the realization of terrible news. 

Unlike before in my past stories, this was not a security loophole, this was not a breach through intrusive means, this was merely a self important uppity user who thought they were above the law, so to speak, because they were a high performer.  Thankfully they were from a branch that was only 2 miles away, so we were able to head this one off at the pass in terms of limiting their ability to gripe to the correct people to get their accounts turned back on. 

This day was a bad day for me in the terms of management. And a worse day in terms of paperwork. I never had to fill out legal forms before... 

To be continued tomorrow. "
talesfromtechsupport,"This is a second hand story told to me 20 years ago by someone who was already a veteran sysadmin back then, so it could have happened in the 80s or early 90s.

The scene is a factory making heavy machinery. They are modern and the factory floor had terminals connected to a mainframe for tracking parts and whatever else they needed it for.

One day a sysadmin gets a call from the factory floor and after the usual pleasantries the user says:

> I can't log in when I stand up.

The sysadmin thinks that it's one of those calls again and goes through the usual:

> Is the power on? What do you see on the terminal? Have you forgotten your password?

The user interrupts:

> I know what I'm doing, when I sit down I can log in and everything works, but I can't log in when I stand up.

The sysadmin tries to explain that there can be no possible connection between the chair and the terminal and sitting or standing should in no way affect the ability to log in. After a long back and forth on the phone, he finally gives up and walks to the factory floor to show the user that standing can't affect logging in.

The sysadmin sits down at the terminal, gets the password from the user, logs in and everything is fine. Turns to the user and says:

> See? It works, your password is fine.

The user answers:

> Yeah, told you, now log out, stand up and try again.

The sysadmin obliges, logs out, stands up, types the password and: *invalid password*. Ok, that's just bad luck. He tries again: *invalid password*. And again: *invalid password*. Baffled by this, the sysadmin tries his own mainframe account standing: *invalid password*. He sits down and manages to log in just fine. This has now turned from crazy user to a really fascinating debugging problem.

The word spreads about the terminal with the chair as an input device and other people start flocking around it. Those are technical people in a relatively high tech factory, they are all interested in fun debugging. Production grinds to a halt. Everyone wants to try if they are affected, it turns out that most people can log in just fine, but there are certain people who can't log in standing and there are quite a few who can't log in regardless of standing or sitting.

After a long debugging session they find it. Turns out that some joker pulled out two keys from the keyboard and switched their places. Both the user and the sysadmin had one of those letters in the password. They were both relatively good at typing and didn't look down at the keyboard when typing when sitting. But typing when standing is something they weren't used to and had to look down at the keyboard which made them press the wrong keys. Some users couldn't type properly and never managed to log in. While others didn't have those letters in their passwords and the switched keys didn't bother them at all."

talesfromtechsupport,"Realized this may not be ""tech support"" in the usual sense but it's a fun story anyway...

Client provided a PSD file that she wanted converted into an HTML file. PSD was 600 pixels wide. I sliced and diced the file, converted live text where possible, uploaded the HTML page to the server and provided her with the URL.

I then get a frantic email which turns into the below conversation:

Client: This is terrible! Everything is so much bigger. It looks nothing like the PSD I gave you.

Me: What do you mean ""so much bigger""?

Client: It's huge! You have to re-code this so that it matches what I provided

Me: (utterly confused) So that I know exactly what the problem is, could you provide a screenshot of what you're seeing?

Client: (Sends a screenshot of Photoshop and Safari side-by-side. They look identical)

Me: They actually look the same to me. They should both be 600 pixels wide. I didn't alter the PSD at all

Client: (Tech savvy enough to know how to ""inspect element"" in Safari) Okay, yeah, it's 600 pixels but why is it so huge?! This is unacceptable. I'm going to send this job to someone else to re-code.

At this point I have no idea what to say or do. I decide to look at her screenshot again and this time I notice her Safari window says ""33%."" Evidently the zoom setting on her Safari browser was at 300%, but in the screenshot she sent me, it was scaled down to fit on the screen (which defeats the entire purpose of sending a screenshot to show the discrepancy).

Me: Can you make sure you're not zooming in in your Safari browser? Your screenshot looks like that might be the issue

(No reply)

Several hours later, client emails me again for another project, not mentioning this issue at all.

Me: By the way, is that other project approved?

Client: Yes.

No apology or sign of humility. This client does this kind of stuff all the time. I'll never understand how she is smart enough to know about pixel width and analyzing image properties, yet still pulls out stuff like this.

I couldn't get there until after work, and when I did it was working. She said she called google to fix it (it was not a google product, nor does it use any google services) so I thought she googled the company number and had them fix it. 

I wanted to show her it wasn't google she called, so I checked the caller ID. 

It was google. After a while on the phone a google tec support guy helped her set up an unrelated product for free.

talesfromtechsupport,"Actors in this play are as follows. This happened yesterday by the way. Today's events will be posted tomorrow. 

> $HHR=Head of HR  

> $Me = ME

> $HIT = Head of IT

> $T = Tech

> $U = User

I got an email this morning with a scathing report about one of my techs. 

> $HHR - I need to inform you of a situaiton I have been made aware of. It seems one of your techs massively violated the IT data policy and security policy last night. I have gone ahead and submitted the termination paperwork to your boss $HIT. 

> Please be aware that this kind of behavior will never be tolerated. I hope that I never have to remind you of this again.

Around this time one of the accounts team comes over and asks about this. I told them that it was not approved by me and to keep it quiet while I discuss it with $hit. 

The discussion did not take long as the event in question was already flagged for defense. IE I personally flagged it because the tech told me it may come back to bit him in the ass. 

I re-review the call logs and oh boy is it dumb. I will just skip to the part in question. 

> $U - Yes I need that mapped to the B drive (branch drive). 

> $T - I can do that for you, however you should know that this location is already mapped to the S drive for scanning. 

> $U - ...OK? I am not understanding what you mean. 

> $T - The drive you are requesting access to is already mapped to a different drive letter. 

> $U - No I need access to the B drive not the S drive. *Talking to coworkers thinking she is out of earshot.* Wow when did they hire idiots to work on the helpdesk? ... I know right. Its like we are the dumb ones or something.

Had to clean up the audio in *free audio tool everyone uses* first but I was able to get it by compressing it twice. 

> $T - OK I will just map the drive for you. 

> $U - You do know you are speaking to a member of management right?

> $T - *Mutes mic noise* Lady I don't care. You are not my manager and are not involved in my management chain. *Unmutes mic noise* Yes mam I do understand that. I apologize if I have come across as terse. I have mapped the drive here. 

> $U - Wait...this is the same as the S drive. 

> $T - *mutes mic again* I just said that...you know what? *unmutes mic* Yes I had said that earlier that you already had the drive mapped.

> $U - YOU CANT HAVE! ... You cant have 2 access points to the same data. This is a HUGE violation. 

> $T - Umm no it is not. Everyone who is on citrix has an ""access point"" to the same data. 

> $U - No they do not. No one has access to MY computer. 

> $T - Well mam we actually do cause citrix does not run on your computer. It runs off of a server here in *our city.* See watch this.

He placed a text file on her desktop named ""test.""

> $U - YOU JUST ACCESSED MY SYSTEM!!! I did NOT authorize that. What is the name of your manager. 

> $T - I just sent you an email with the contact information for $Me and $HIT

> $U - I am sorry but I have no choice now. I have to report this massive violation to your managers. *hangs up*

I emailed $HHR back with this lovely gem.

> $ME - After reviewing the event in question, it has been determined that the fault lie 100 percent with the user here. Her clear lack of knowledge in regards to basic server technology led to her thinking she had her machine breached. 

> I have canceled the termination order on my end as well as the emergency maintenance ticket she put in to the orders team. 

> In the future all concerns about my team are to come through me. We have a process for terminating an employee, which you set up, that you violated. The employee in question did nothing wrong and was unjustly judged by people who have no understanding of basic computer technology. 

> Please do not violate the policy you set in place for terminating an employee in the future...I hope that I never have to remind you of this again.

I sent a copy of that to $hit the CIO and the EVPIT. (Or the executive vice president of IT and Technology) 

About 2 hours later I get an email back from the EVPIT. He apologized for the way that the head of HR acted and promised me that the tech in question will not receive any punishment as he listened to the call himself. 

Two hours later I am being told that my anual employee review is being pushed up to tomorrow by the head of HR. "
talesfromtechsupport,"LTL; FTP. None of the names I'm giving here (besides my username) are real. I work for a surgery center. So does Sandy. Sandy is a very kind (gullible, evidently) older lady who mans the switchboard phones. 

This is about the day I upgraded Sandy's computer. 

This is about the day I made Sandy cry.

>Glass: And there you are. Do you have any questions I can answer about your new setup before I go work on the other tickets today?

>Sandy: Well, how am I supposed to use it? 

Did I mention this was a particularly off-kilter day, and I had deployed the machine without a keyboard or mouse?

>Glass: Oh, these new machines don't require keyboards or mice anymore. There's actually a neural implant, very low power and completely painless. It makes it a truly wireless experience, and the procedure only takes about 45 minutes. We have you booked for operating room 7 with Dr. Smith at 12:15

>Sandy: But...but I... 

>*At this point, Sandy's eyes start to bug out and she bursts into tears.*

>Glass: Oh my God! I'm so sorry! I'm Joking! I just forgot your keyboard and mouse. There is no implant, I was pulling your leg. Please ~~don't go to HR~~ forgive me! I'm going to go get your keyboard and mouse right now!

This was many years ago now, but I still feel bad about it. Luckily she calmed down (and found it funny) a few minutes after I explained that I was joking. "
talesfromtechsupport,"Long time lurker, first time poster.  This happened last week:

$Boss:  Hey Krieg, I didn't know we could print on our fax machine

$Me: Sorry?  That's not a printer, just a fax machine

$Boss: Nop, it prints as well.  (while showing me some pages that came from the fax machine) I printed this document and it came out of the fax machine instead of the printer.  I was surprised myself.

$Me: It is not possible.  The fax machine it is just a fax machine.

$Boss: Well, then from where this came from?

$Me: I have no idea, but the fax is not a printer.

$Boss: I will prove it to you.  I will print this other document.

$Me: Go ahead.





10 minutes later




$Boss:  Hey Krieg, the fax machine it is finally printing.  It took a bit but it is now printing that document I told you.

$Me: WTH?  This can't be.  The fax machine is not a printer.  Let me see and I try to figure out what's going on.


I printed out the journal report from the fax machine and I see the last entries are from a number in Hong Kong.   I check the number and it belongs to our branch in Hong Kong so I give them a call.  Finally the puzzle is solved.


$Me: Hey $Boss, I know what's going on with the fax machine

$Boss: You realized it is a printer as well?

$Me: Have you been to Hong Kong lately?

$Boss: Yes, I was there last week for some meetings.

$Me: Did you try to print anything while you where there?

$Boss: Yes.

$Me: How did you manage to get your print outs to come out of the printer over there?

$Boss: I had to configure their printer in my notebook

$Me: Have you checked you are not still printing in the Hong Kong printer?

$Boss: Why?

$Me: Well, you have been printing all the time in the Hong Kong printer.   The printer is besides a secretary who thought your documents where very important so she faxed them to us.

talesfromtechsupport,"This happened during my tenure as a T1 at a mid sized call center in 2001.  Like most call centers a ticket was required for any IT problem mainly because we had around 500 users on line at any one time.  Most of the users understood this and followed the rules pretty well.  Except for the new supervisors. Most were in their early 20s and it was usually their first time in any type of position of power (hey they now got an inbox/outbox and their own stapler they must be important).  

Liz lived up to this to a ridiculous degree,  every problem led to a panicked call to us followed by a dash to our office when told  to open a ticket.   ""This has to be fixed right now"" she would wail ""I'm a supervisor"".  Since most of her problems would be resolved with a couple of key strokes I decided to nip this problem in the bud. 

As soon as she would call I knew I had a couple of minutes as she made a mad dash down the stairs to pound on our door to plead her case in person.   Now Liz was just a stunningly good looking girl so most of my co-workers (also in their 20s and as awkwardly nerdy as you would imagine would jump to help her). I however was in my early 40s and fortunately immune to her looks.  So I took to using remote desktop to fix her problem while I knew she was heading towards our office (locking her computer was not necessary I guess). I would begrudgingly follow her upstairs to ""see"" the problem which was already fixed.  She would swear that it wasn't doing whatever before and that it must have fixed itself.   

After about the fifth time I did this I dropped this on her.  ""Liz I'm a happily married man and I just don't like you like that"". ""If you don't stop trying to get me alone like this I'm going to have to go to HR"". 

Liz started using the help desk after that and me at my co-workers shared a laugh every time one of her tickets came in."

talesfromtechsupport,"Some time ago, I got possibly the best bug report ticket ever filed.

A piece of software I'd written would completely crap out under extremely
specific circumstances, upon encountering web pages written in a way I thought
completely insane. What I naively didn't realize is that, due to the
extraordinary leniency of web browsers in parsing invalid HTML, a lot of web
pages are written in a *completely* insane way.

So, one user happened to run the software on one of these little HTML
monstrosities, and it broke. An average user, if they would even consider such
extreme measures as *reporting* a bug, would write something like:

    Expected behavior: It works
    Actual behavior: It doesn't
    Reproduction steps: Visit a website

I've seen way too many tickets like this. This user wasn't an ""average"" user
though. This guy was a *unicorn*.

The bug report included **a link to a tiny page hosted on a VPS of his that would cause the bug to occur**. He had
enough knowledge and did enough testing on his own to *write a minimal example*
that still triggered it.

I still have that ticket printed out and pinned to the wall right above my
desk.

"
talesfromtechsupport,"Again, I have a horrible client. People like him should be forbidden from hiring web developers.

He calls me, mad:

> Client: ""Hey! I was under the impression that this website would work on a laptop!""

> Client: ""So if I were to get on a laptop right now, you're telling me it would work?""

> Me: ""Yes... Like I said, it works on a laptop.""

> Me: ""Well, 1) I wrote the website, 2) this ain't my first rodeo, and 3) I USE A LAPTOP!""

> Client: ""You have a laptop?!""

> Me: ""Yes! You've seen it. It's my primary computer""

talesfromtechsupport,"$FMB = $FlexMoneyBiceps, this handsome hunk of flesh, not a robot, you can't prove it, and working L1 ISP support during this time

$CC = $CrazyCustomer, an ISP customer who doesn't understand how webmail, or craiglist, in the end, works

--

So this is a story from when I used to work at $RelativelyMediumSizedISP. $RMSISP, like all ISPs stuck in the 90s, provided (and still provides, though I think they're trying to get away from that) email addresses for all of their customers, with webmail to come with it. I'm abbreviating the story a bit and cutting out the filler- it's been a while, and I can't exactly remember the exact words.

Phone rings.

-

$FMB: Hi, this is $ISP tech support, how can I help you?

$CC: You [fantastic people] got me [fantastically] fired! I can't even access my webmail, you [amazing people]! I just wanted you to move it from my home computer to my work computer!

$FMB: I'm sorry to hear that- but it's webmail, you can access it from any computer just by going to (webmail address) and putting in your username and password.

$CC: Yeah but it's on my [fantastic] work computer now! I want it on my home computer! You guys need to stop doing such a [swell] job and do your [goshdarn fantastic] job!

$FMB: Is it not showing up in your webmail? Do you have a client that you have, that's set to POP3?

$CC: I don't use a mail client or whatever! I just want my [goshdarn] email! And I want you to pay my lost wages!

--

--

Obviously, this isn't how webmail works. She doesn't want to hear it, though. I am curious at this point how the 'fired' bit is going to come in- I know it will somewhere along the line.

--

--

$FMB: Okay, I can definitely help you with accessing your webmail. Let's get a browser window open- whichever you prefer, IE, Firefox, Chrome... (I always listed these just in case they didn't know what a browser actually was.)

$CC: No! Your tech came out here, moved my webmail from my home computer to my work computer, and then my job [fantastically] fired me for it! You need to send someone back out here to fix your [swell] job, you [fantastically amazing people]!

--

--

Checking her records, she hadn't had a tech out since installation. What?

--

--

$FMB: Ma'am, we haven't sent anyone out to your location since you got your internet installed. Who did you have come out?

$CC: One of your techs! I told you! I'm going to quit my service you [goshdarn swell...bags]! I demand you reimburse me!

$FMB: Did you call in for tech support first? (She doesn't have any recent calls logged either.)

$CC: No, [smart donkey], I went to craigslist and just had one of your internet people come out!

--
--
--
***what.***
--

--

--
$FMB: ...Ma'am, let me get this straight. You went to Craigslist and hired someone to move your webmail, which is on our servers, from your home computer, to your work computer?

$CC: Yes! How is that so hard to understand? I hired one of your internet people, and now my job has fired me because they said something about 'unauthorized access' and 'tampering with company equipment'! What did your [amazing, fun-loving] tech do?!

$FMB: Ma'am, people you hire from Craigslist aren't associated with $ISP. We don't do anything with Craigslist.

$CC: It's on the internet! You're the internet company! I want you to come back out here, get my webmail off my old work computer, and I want you to pay me for the job you made me lose! Now!

$FMB: ...I can help you with getting your webmail, ma'am, if you're willing to troubleshoot and work with me here, but we will not be reimbursing you for your job.

$CC: Then I don't want to talk to you, you [fun-loving amazing swell bag]! Get me your supervisor!

So I escalated it up. While I had the lady on hold, and was explaining the situation to the L2 who had to deal with her, I legitimately had a hard time explaining it because I was laughing so hard. I loved these kinds of calls- we can't help you, we won't help you, you won't let us help you, and you're nuclear fire mad. It's the best. Then I got promoted a week later and my job ended up consisting almost entirely of these types of calls.


-

End of the story- she didn't let the L2 show her how to get into webmail, she threatened to sue about the reimbursement, and then she got stonewalled right to legal after making that threat. I don't think she called in ever again.
"
talesfromtechsupport,"A few years ago I was sent to our Italian office where the 3 Italian IT guys were to train up their new IT Support Guy there on how to manage his help desk stuff.  Things were going really well and one day they decided that we should all go out for a traditional Italian meal - a Turkish Kebab.

We got to the kebab shop and I'm trying to read the menu and getting some help from the team.  The guy behind the counter can fortunately speak English and he wants to practise so we get talking and I place my order of 1xAwesomeKebab.    

He then asks me what an English speaking guy is doing in Italy so I make the mistake of telling him that I'm here doing ""IT Stuff"".

That was all he needed to hear.  About 15 seconds later I have this knackered old laptop running Windows 7 with a Turkish operating system that ""won't work"" and there's an error when he tries to do stuff with it.  

So I tried to help as he was preparing my food and I like helping people anyway.  My kebab turns up and I slowly ate it over the course of about 20minutes while I tried my hardest using context and experience to figure out what was wrong from the description he gave me that ""something was wrong with his internet connection and it didn't work"".

I managed to work out that it looked like his network card was broken and non-functioning and that he could maybe try re-installing it from the original disks he had or get a cabled connection so he could get the drivers if he didn't have the disks.  

He seemed happy with this and brought us our bill.  He went round the table collecting the money and when he got to me he said 

""Not you my friend, today, you eat for free!""

The kebab was totally worth the impromptu tech support."
techsupport,"Figured I should write this stuff down before I forget it all, and where better for TaskManager than r/techsupport!  If there's any appetite for this, I'll expand on it!   I don't blog, so here goes...

Some Task Manager lore: I'm the Microsoft (Redmond, '93) developer that wrote TaskMgr at home in my den in about 1994 and then the NT silverback devs let me check it into the main tree even though I was a greenhorn at the time.  So that meant I got to bring it into work and polish it up and make it an official part of Windows, where it remains to this day.  So I got to define my own day job, actually, which was nice!  I don't know if it's still like that, but great culture and people.

This is all based on XP, as I left long ago, but it's still the same core app underneath.  In no particular order:

\- If Task Manager ever hangs or crashes, start another by pressing ctrl-shift-esc.  Winlogon will look for an existing instance and try to revive it for up to 10 seconds.  If the old Taskmgr doesn't start making sense by responding with a secret code within that time, another one will be launched.  That way, you're never without a Taskmgr as long as there are some resources available.

\- Task Manager will load in reduced mode if resources are short, like only loading the Processes page if that's what's needed to get going.  It's one of the very few apps that won't just ""fail and bail"" when things go wrong.

\- If Task Manager ever becomes internally corrupted, kill/close it.  Restart it while holding down CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT, and Task Manager will reset ALL internal settings to factory fresh if it sees that key combo at startup.  Same works for every app I've written, btw, I think!

\- If all your titlebars disappear and you just have a graph, double-click dead client space to switch back to normal mode.  This no-titlebar mode is a mode I added to follow the NT clock, where you could remove borders as well, but it confused more people than it ever helped I'm sure!

\- I initially drew the meters as 7-segment LEDs but that wasn't localizable to all cultures (How do you do a right-to-left reading 7-segment LED for Saudi Arabia?) so they only lasted for one version or so.

\- CTRL-SHIFT-ESC will launch Taskmgr without any help from the Shell, so if the Shell/Explorer is dead use this key combo to bring up TM and then reset/restart the shell.  Even if your tray is missing and gone, this combo should start it.

\- If the shell can't start something or is hung, try Task Manager.  It has a mode where it will load without ANY references to the shell32.dll and allow you to start programs like CMD.EXE without the start menu.

\- You can find the binary for any executing process in the process table by right clicking and pick ""Show File Location"".  You can also search it online, but I don't know if they have useful info for much.

\- There should be nothing that TaskMgr can't kill - it will even escalate privilege and (if you have it) enable debug privilege to attach to and kill apps that way if needed.  If TM can't kill it, you've got a kernel problem.

\- A lot of people don't seem to know you can add many additional columns, remove others, drag them around to reorder, etc.

\- The reason there's a Window class called ""DavesFrameWndProc"" is because to get flicker-free resizing I needed group boxes to not try to paint on one another, so subclass them, give them their own wndproc, and enabling WS\_CLIPSIBLINGS during WM\_CREATE.  At least I think so!

\- TM is one of the apps I'm most proud of because it is probably the first or at least most visually complicated app to ever be fully resizable in all dimensions without any flicker up till then.  I was hardcore about memory and flicker in my day, so it was under 100K for the exe and never flashed or crashed, that was my thing!  Having the GDI32 and User32 guys down the hall sure helped.

I also wrote/ported Space Cadet pinball, zip folders, worked on start menu, shell, calc, ole32, product activation, and some other stuff.  I was in MS-DOS before that but I doubt anyone is still supporting MS-DOS!  


Edit:  Looks like comments have been locked, so I'll update this one time with some answers to the most interesting/common questions below!  


\- On the command line, I'm stumped, as I don't remember command line args to it at all!

\- On Space Cadet, yes, you can run it on Windows 10, but I doubt it's official or legal, so will point you at your favorite search engine for that one, but it's easy.  And on Space Cadet, reminder that Maxis did the very original (M. Ridgeway) and mine was just a rewrite in 32-bit portable C using their art.  That way it ran on the PowerPC, Alpha, and MIPS as well.  And yes, in the original there is a ""God Mode"" where you can drag the ball around, click on targets, etc.  Search is your friend there as well.

\- On what I'm doing these days, I volunteer to teach kids to program at school, or used to until recently, so now I'm mostly coding and working on my coding channel, which you can follow here: [https://bit.ly/36wDLJK](https://bit.ly/36wDLJK) and I also restore old musclecars, pickups, etc.  So yes, I still code every day!

\- On the notion that there are some things that Taskmgr can't kill, there were post-XP for sure but they were intentional limits.  I remember something about journalists making news by using TM to kill the root winlogon session, for example, which would bugcheck the machine intentionally.  But the fact you could bluescreen NT didn't look good, I suspect, so they likely started to protect people from themselves by disallowing killing win32k.sys and other essential components.  

\- Thanks to the mods for being flexible on this one!  "

techsupport,"I have been at it 6 hours trying to do it myself.  My lawyer has a guy that does it for $2,500 - but that is way out of my wheelhouse.  I'd pay for help if the video was recovered, but I'm not the kind of guy with more than $500 to ""play"" with.  I know your time is valuable, so let me know what you need to do it.  I will answer any questions you have up-front and with pure honesty.

EDIT:  Anybody in the Houston area I will come to personally.
EDIT 2:  All good advice got gold, I left a comment asking for PayPal info to compensate the best of the thread.  Thank you.  Please send me your PayPal info.

EDIT 3:  Got up to take a piss at 2:30am, and holy shit.  Let me clarify a few things.  1) I was not belligerent - not until I had the knee in my face - then it was mostly ""what the fuck.""  2) I don't care to waste my time suing anyone who doesn't deserve it.  Karma in real life might actually be a real thing.  3)  I don't need to beat a DUI.  They took the blood without an arrest and without a warrant.  In Texas, that gets suppressed with a quickness.  4)If I was acting like a belligerent asshole,  show me one cop that wouldn't take me in right then.  5) Regardless of all that other BS and the court of Reddit administering a verdict, I still really, really need this video.

EDIT 4:  2 things - 1... I am working through all of your suggestions (making a list now, setting up in the morning). PHONE IS OFF.  I had 20GB of free space on the internal.  No SD, no Cloud, No Hamster.  2....  I know as much as the next guy how people can be on the internet.  That's not me.  Know why?  Because I'm trying to get the video back, that's why.  What the fuck would I want of a video of me deservedly getting attacked after treating a medical team like shit?  ""I'm Rob Lowe and this is Dickhead Asshat Doctor Provoking Rob Lowe with cable?""

EDIT 5 (Tuesday): No rooting programs are working.  I copied every folder from my phone to my computer.  It turns out that Verizon's SM-N910V has something called a bootblocker or some shit like that.  So I am on to manually try this out.

EDIT 6 (Tuesday Afternoon):  There is no way to root this phone without dealing with a bootloader or something that every forum says we have to wait for.  I contacted a Data Forensics company in Austin that might be able to do something, but if I have to go that route I am going to have to wait until I get paid on the 15th.  They are going to call me back sometime today to let me know if they can even do anything.  Meanwhile, any suggestions that require the phone to be rooted are no good.  I can't thank y'all enough, though.  I'll deliver something as soon as I figure out what I need to do next.

EDIT 7 (Tuesday still):  I have a call with the guy from Austin at 2pm or so Central - I'll let y'all know what he thinks.

EDIT 8 (Tues.):  They are going to email me some detailed info regarding what they do to get the video.  Obviously, I probably won't understand one fucking detail, but I'll post it here.  For now, you guys stay awesome.  I need to get some work done.

EDIT 9:  YOU GUYS ARE ABOVE-AVERAGE!!!!  A company in Oklahoma just offered to forensically recover the video for me as pro-bono, pro-civil right, just plain badass way to help me out.  Once again, no matter what....  I will post the video as soon as I can, no matter how it makes me look.   I am Fed-Exing the phone there this afternoon.

EDIT 10:  Continuing my policy of ""surely delivering"" I give you a copy of the [overnight shipping receipt.](http://imgur.com/xCeaNpf)

EDIT 11:  Not much new today to report except that my phone arrived at the Data Forensics facility.  FedEx Tracking 807519987715

EDIT 12:  Wednesday activities:  Phone will be dumped by Thursday morning when recovery work will commence.

EDIT 13:  Got an email this morning (Thursday) saying they are recovering the data today.  That does not mean shit to the great reveal.  I made the mistake of scrolling too low in some of the other threads this ended up on, and I am not having my integrity questioned anymore - at least where I can do something about it.  [This is my Uber receipt](http://imgur.com/iRjEBul) from the night of the incident showing that I went HOME and did not, as some claim, have a DWI that I am just covering up for.  Check the address, it is the hospital - not the jail.

EDIT 14:  I had another update from the guys in OKC with my phone.  They were able to pull a lot of old contacts, messages, etc. from my phone, but no video.  They want to use a new code they have for this new phone (Verizon Note 4) to see what they can get.  They estimate a Tuesday completion.  That does not mean I am going to upload the video if I get it right away.  My attorney and ABC-13 in Houston are going to make sure that anything I upload does not violate HIPPA laws.  I am here for any other questions anyone has, but you have to be as patient as I am before I upload the video.  I spoke with my attorney today and he is being very cautious about how we go about this.  I got a copy of my medical records from that night which are full of contradictory statements.  You all can expect no updates over the weekend.  Not because I am being deceptive, but mostly because my attorney has a newborn, I need to catch up with my job, and the guys in OKC don't work over the weekend.  This is going to be a process, and as much as I want to deliver ASAP, the data is going to be delivered and the story develops --- and that shit takes time.  I am always available to answer questions if you message me.

EDIT 15 (Monday Night):  Nothing new to report.  Last Friday I was told that there would be either a yes or no on recovery by close of business on Tuesday.  I'm not rushing anybody, so I didn't ask for an update today.  I probably will tomorrow.  I see all of the ""RemindMe"" things, and I want you all to know that it is still in the works.  The sheer amount of professionalism going into this is going to be a valuable addition to the people on this sub that I intended to interact with before this blew up.  I think we are all going to be in a position to learn ""real(ish) time"" how they are handling this.  I don't know dick-one about what is going on technically with my phone, but I'm sure we'll get some insight soon.

EDIT 16 (Tuesday Night):  There is still nothing new to report.  

EDIT 17 (Wednesday Afternoon):  The email from the data forensics company:

>Hello again Reddit friend,
>
>Long story short, you are boned. Our forensic devices were able to semi-dump this phone, but the video you are looking for was not in the dumps.
>
>So here is the long story. The Verizon Note 4 is bootloader locked with no known exploit. It has several security systems in place to make sure you (the owner) don't get to do anything with the phone that Samsung and VZW dont approve of, UNLESS you buy the Verizon Note 4 'Developer Edition'. The reason that this matters to you, is that there is no way currently to access a full bit-for-bit copy of the internal storage.

>Our resident Android Guru has been working on this solid since we got your phone (partly because of the almost $15000 reward for it), but is up against a wall as well.
>
>In effect, you are out of luck on recovering the video until an exploit is found for this phone (which it may or may not ever be). Your options are to keep the phone safe and unused somewhere until the phones security is broken, or to move on.
>
>I wish we had better news, and I wish that Android phone manufacturers would keep these open source phones open, and not locked like Fort Knox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Knox).

>Please get me your shipping address and we will overnight the phone back to you. I am sorry, and I know this is not what you were hoping for, us either!

They also included a spreadsheet breaking down the bounty for unlocking the phone.  Either way, this is good information for this sub, I'd assume, and bad for the people with the pictchforks and such.  My attorney is still moving forward, and that is going to be a long process, so if your ""RemindMe"" shit doesn't have ""months"" somewhere in it, you can forget that.

Seriously, the internet is awesome when you look at it from the standpoint of I cane to this sub to get a result and I got one (good or bad).  It sucks when apparently I became a ""Karma Whore"" somewhere in here.  You all can think what you want, but seriously, how does this matter to your life?  Stop being so cynical.  In the words of [Conan O'Brien.](http://youtu.be/AcF1OoWqXBc?t=3m47s)

EDIT 18 (Feb 16):  Some of y'all need to get a life.  I'm not some cop-bashing anti-anything attention seeker.  I came here for a tech support issue and got exactly that.  If the result isn't what you had hoped for, too goddamned bad, go upstairs and cry to your mom.  The people who help out in here are awesome, and shouldn't have to deal with some of you terrible, terrible human beings who for whatever reason think that the reading and commenting on a story makes them somehow entitled to anything. Nobody owes you shit, get used to it.  

Final Outcome (November):  The company from Oklahoma tried to get the video out of the phone for no charge and could not get it. I knew that the hospital had cameras and I tried to get a lawyer where I am to take the case on a contingency fee basis which was unsuccessful. Not an exciting conclusion to the story, but it is what it is.  Thank you all, I hope you all have a happy holiday season.

Super Three-Year-Later Edit: This pissed me off so much, I went to law school and became an attorney and now do defense work in Texas. 

Super Duper Edit - This turned into a radio episode, and yes, apparently you can edit this shit in perpetuity. http://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2018/09/07/tim-from-texas"

 *If you suspect you are infected with any form of malware that encrypts your files, DO NOT follow this guide! Please make a post instead. Your files are at stake.*

&#x200B;

**Tip:** Windows 7 and below is no longer supported by Microsoft and UNSAFE to use. If you are still running Windows 7 with a LEGIT license, you can obtain a free upgrade to Windows 10 by using the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) from Microsoft. They have been very generous in continuing to allow users to upgrade from Windows 7 at no charge. *Do this upgrade AFTER your system has been cleaned of malware. A system image backup is highly recommended before starting this process. This backup can be performed to an external hard drive with the* [Backup & Restore tool](https://i.imgur.com/B0I3FgI.png) *located in the Control Panel on Windows 7 and up.*

 

**Purpose & Scope of this Guide:**

This guide is designed to assist you in removing malware from an infected system *that successfully boots*. If your computer is completely unable to boot due to malware, please make a post, as this guide will not help you. If you perform the following steps exactly as described, this will solve your problem in over 90% of scenarios. That said, not all malware is created equal, and not all malware removal tools are created equal. The tools recommended in this guide were picked because of their high success and low failure rates, measured on a very large scale. However, there will be times that this guide fails in removing malware. If that is the case, please make a post for further assistance, stating that this guide was unsuccessful. It is recommended to only accept advice from a “Trusted” technician. I am writing this guide in layman’s terms so that most people will be able to understand it with ease.

 

**Disclaimer:**

The following instructions are recommendations only. You take full responsibility for any steps you choose to perform on your computer. While the following recommendations are performed without issue on countless machines, there is always a risk of damaging your Operating System or experiencing data loss on any machine. **It is solely YOUR responsibility to save all work and back up any and all important data on your system before proceeding.** 

 

**Malware Remediation Steps:**

*Before proceeding, go into your browser’s extensions and remove all suspicious items. Also go into your browser’s settings and remove any default search providers and unusual homepages. If you are unsure how to do this, proceed to Step 1.*

 

*Download and run the following tools in this order. Run all tools unless otherwise instructed. All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or the scans fail in Normal Mode. All tools must be run under an Administrator account. Do not remove any tool-generated logs in the event a helper needs you to post them to further assist you.*

 

**1) Run** [**rkill.com**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/dl/10/)**. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to finish. Do not reboot when done.**

* Kills running malicious processes
* Removes policies in the registry that prevent normal OS operation
* Repairs file extension hijacks

 

**2) Download an updated copy** [**Malwarebytes 4.0**](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/)**. Turn on the “**[**Scan for Rootkits**](https://i.imgur.com/5lLJB3R.png)**” option. Then, run a “**[**Scan**](https://i.imgur.com/fDFSVy4.png)**”**

* Successfully removes the vast majority of infections
* Has an industry-leading, lightning fast scanning  & heuristics engine
* Has built-in repair tools to fix damage done by malware

 

**3) Run** [**Malwarebytes ADWCleaner 8**](https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/) **using the “**[**Scan Now**](https://i.imgur.com/hwFbaQZ.png)**” button.**

* Removes majority of adware, PuPs, Toolbars, and Browser hijacks
* Scans for bloatware & pre-installed sofware and lets you quarantine any or all of it.
* Fixes proxy settings changed by malware
* Removes certain non-default browser settings

 

 

**Optional, Advanced Step (only run if previous tools fail to solve problem):**

**4) Run Sophos** [**HitmanPro**](http://get.hitmanpro.com/)

* [Here](https://i.imgur.com/oT7CjuN.png) is HitmanPro.

HitmanPro is a phenomenal ""second-opinion"" malware scanner. I recommend clicking ""Settings"" and uncheck ""Scan for tracking cookies"" before starting the scan. This will drastically reduce scan times. This tool can only be run ONCE for free. Use it wisely.

 

**Please note:** If malware has prohibited you from browsing the web or downloading files, you can try running the [NetAdapter Repair Tool](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/netadapter-repair-all-in-one/)  with [all options checked](http://i.imgur.com/XLv1ZUW.png) which will attempt to restore your internet connection & default browser settings. You may have to download these tools on another computer and move them to a flash drive that you can plug into the infected machine.

 

**Think your Mac is infected?**

Try [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/). Please make a post if it is unsuccessful.

 

If you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in /r/techsupport for further assistance.

 

**Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):**

* Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts.
* Consider enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts!
* Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.

 

**What is malware?**

[Malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. \[Source: Wikipedia.com\]

 

**How did I get infected?**

It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher’s website directly.

 

**How to prevent future infections:**

Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using [Ninite](http://ninite.com) for installing/updating software is very easy & safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.

 

**The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:**

 

**Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:**

* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)
* [BitDefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)
* [ESET Free Online Scanner](http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/)

Free AVs will only go so far. I highly recommend purchasing the AV of your choice to get better protection. Companies who offer products for free are usually making money off you one way or another. This has been [proven again recently with Avast](https://www.cnet.com/news/antivirus-firm-avast-is-reportedly-selling-users-web-browsing-data/). If you use Avast, uninstall it immediately.

**Helpful Tools:**

* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement)
* [uBlock Origin Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) (Blocks ads)"

Basically what this means is that if you're still using it, you should probably stop using it, or patch it with ESU, or do something else to stay protected.

In this post we'll be going over some of the options you have, including:

* Upgrade to Windows 10.
* Switch to a Linux distro such as Ubuntu.
* Switch to a Mac, if you don't like the above.
* Modify your system to allow ESU patches.
* Unplug your Windows 7 computer from the Internet.
* Keep using your Windows 7 computer as-is and risk malware.
* Stop using desktop computers entirely.

We'll also go over some ways to stay secure, regardless of which of the above you choose.

# Upgrade to Windows 10

For many people reading this post, this is your best option.

Upgrading to Windows 10 is the only option that guarantees you can keep using *all* of the latest software and playing *all* of the latest Windows games. Many newer games, especially VR games, only support Windows 10 (and not Windows 7 or 8.1).

There is still some choices you can make of which version and edition of Windows you want. Windows 10 has various editions, including Home, Pro, Education, and Enterprise. Enterprise gives you the most control over your system, while Home gives you the least control over it, and Pro is somewhere in-between. Enterprise is not typically available to consumers, you have to go through a business. Education has the same feature set as Enterprise, but it is licensed for schools.

If you are in school, you should see if you are eligible for a license for Windows 10 Education. If not, see if you have a way to obtain a Windows 10 Enterprise license. If not, you can very likely [upgrade your Windows 7 or 8.1 installation for free](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/). If none of those options work for you, and you need to pay for a new license, the Pro version is preferable to the Home version.

Aside from installing and activating manually, you could also just buy a new computer that comes with Windows 10.

The main downside to upgrading to Windows 10 is that it gives you less control over your system, with features such as auto-installing apps (not a problem on Enterprise and Education editions), forced updates, Cortana, and vastly more ""telemetry"" services. Even if you hate spying, Windows 10 still may be your best option simply due to the advantage of running all the latest AAA games.

Microsoft provides an official way to download Windows 10 here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10

If you need help installing a newer version of Windows, check out this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/wiki/windowsinstallation

# Switch to a Linux distro such as Ubuntu

These days, Linux distros are truly a great alternative to Windows. Linux is very stable and secure, and does everything an average user wants, whether that be Facebook or writing essays. If you are a gamer, Linux has thousands of native games and many more are available via Proton, you can play the majority of games on Steam on Linux with no hassle.

If you play games with heavy DRM or anti-cheat, or play VR games, or frequently use Adobe products, Linux may not be a good option for you. But even if you do play those games or use those products, you also have the option of dual-booting, so that you can have both Windows and Linux installed at the same time. This post doesn't go too much into detail on Linux, since the below links are already great resources.

Most importantly, Linux is 100% free, so you can give it a try without any risks, and switch back to Windows whenever you wish.

For more information about switching to Linux, see this post on the Linux gaming subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/edaq0s/guide_migrating_to_linux_in_2020/

When you are ready to install Linux, check out this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/wiki/linuxinstallation

If you'd like a more concrete guide, this PDF focuses specifically on setting up Ubuntu for gaming, including setting up drivers, Steam, and more, with a focus on dual-booting: https://github.com/aaronfranke/Linux-tools/raw/master/ubuntu-only/qsg.pdf

# Switch to a Mac

This is the only option that *requires* you to buy new hardware, since MacOS only runs on Macs, and will not run on a non-Mac PC. Macs are great systems overall, they are very secure and are a favorite option of many developers and businesses.

The downsides of Mac are that it is expensive, and if you are a gamer, that it runs vastly fewer games. These days, Mac is a worse choice for gaming than Linux is.

# Modify your system to allow ESU patches

Microsoft is selling [Extended Support Updates](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4527878/faq-about-extended-security-updates-for-windows-7) for Windows 7 users who can't upgrade for whatever reason. This is aimed at businesses, but you can still get ESU for Windows 7 Professional edition. [The cost of ESU](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-much-will-staying-patched-on-windows-7-cost-you-heres-the-price-list/) is $50 for the first year, $100 for the second year, and $200 for the third year. If you can't afford this, there may be unofficial methods to obtain these updates.

# Disconnect your Windows 7 computer from the Internet

This is a fairly simple option that doesn't need too much explanation. If you unplug your computer from the Internet, you can't get viruses from the Internet. As long as you don't pass around infected USB flash drives, then you are pretty much immune from viruses if you aren't connected to the Internet. Of course, for many people, this makes your computer unusable.

# Keep using your Windows 7 computer as-is and risk malware

This is a terrible option, since it's very insecure to do this. This option maybe isn't too bad if you don't have any sensitive data whatsoever on your machine, and it's an option worth mentioning, but this option is not recommended.

# Stop using desktop computers entirely

If you don't like newer versions of Windows, or Linux distros, or Mac, you need to be on the Internet, and you don't want to be insecure, then the only\* option left is to stop using desktop computers entirely. For a lot of people, this is an unacceptable option, but many people can get away with living in the modern world only using phones and tablets, so it's worth mentioning.

Also, Chromebooks are great if you don't need to do anything on your computer except for browsing the web.

# How to stay secure on any system

No matter what you choose, there are plenty of ways to stay secure online.

Blocking ads helps a ton due to malvertizing. The browser extension uBlock Origin ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ublock/)) does a great job at blocking ads. Additionally, it's a great idea to get a [hosts-file adblocker](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts) or a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) to block ads before they even get to your system in the first place.

The browser extension HTTPS Everywhere ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/https-everywhere/)) will automatically redirect you to the secure version of a website, if there is one. This is a simple and easy way to improve your security while browsing the web.

If you are running Windows of any kind, getting an anti-virus is generally a good idea. One of the most commonly recommended ones is [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com). A really nice feature of Malwarebytes is that it can run alongside other anti-virus software, so you can use Malwarebytes regardless of if you already have an anti-virus.

Don't forget that these can also be installed on smartphones, not just your desktop PC!

# Conclusion

You should do something to stay secure. Whether you switch to a newer version of Windows, switch to a Linux distro such as Ubuntu, switch to a Mac, unplug your computer from the Internet, or throw it away, they all result in you staying more secure than if you continue to use your computer as-is. And once you've decided what system you're going to use, there are many ways to make it more secure.

techsupport," 

I've been a huge fan of Google up until now; I bought 3 Pixel phones, converted my GF into using Pixel (from iPhone), I have the Pixelbook, and every room has a Google Home or Mini. I even paid to be a Stadia Founder. My GF and I bought a house together and decided to furnish it together as well. She bought over $4,000 worth of furniture, and I sent her something like $2280.58 via Google Pay. She wasn't able to claim the money. We spent hours talking to customer support and each time they swore they would fix it ""in 24 hours."" Finally, we decided to try and send the money back to me, and now I'm not able to re-claim the money I sent to her! We both get a message saying that fraudulent activity has been detected, but each time we call customer support, they swear it'll get resolved (""in 24 hours"").

I've lost count of how many times I've called customer support only to repeat the same thing over again and have them swear it'll get fixed. This nightmare started September 28 and it's now October 11. I'm wondering if going to a lawyer might be the only way to get it back by getting their attention, but I know they can afford a team of the best lawyers and I'm lucky if I can even get someone that knows corporate law.

Has anyone had similar problems? Did anyone figure out how to fix something like this?"

I reported it the moment I saw it. 10 minutes after this, MY proper Instagram profile got deleted. I guess the fake IG profile is older than the real one, because it has a 2013 pricture of me and I made my IG acc. about 2 years ago. But still, what the f***?

techsupport,"I woke up last Sunday morning to find out my Google login was suspended at 1-something in the morning. I figured it was hacked somehow (despite the fact I use two-factor authentication) or my phone had a virus and had been spamming, etc. I followed the prompts to file an appeal and was directed to a single text box where I needed to justify why the account should be reinstated.  I'm a long-term customer and have never been warned or suspended for anything. I was surprised to see they didn't have the professional courtesy to tell me why it was suspended or to provide a warning if they observed anything that would even lead to a suspension.  After talking to someone at Google Fi and then Google Play I was advised that the only thing I could do was submit a response via the form and there was nothing they could do. 
I replied on the web form and then left for the week on business travel.

Let me take a break with the story to tell you about some of the Google products I rely on:

-Fi (signed up when it was still a beta service, just updated to a Pixel 4 XL)
-Nest (awesome that now requires a Google account)
-Gmail (used for all of my personal correspondence)
-Drive
-Chrome
-Others

I received a response THREE DAYS LATER that the account would not be reinstated and had violated the Terms of Service with no further explanation and a link to them for my review. The fact that my home security, text messaging, email, and storage were already out for a few days while I was away from my family was bad enough, but I was absolutely stunned to receive this kind of treatment by a company of this magnitude. I replied again, asking for some justification or steps I could follow to get the account reinstated and have not received a response. That was four days ago. I attempted to port my number to another provider on Friday to get my text messaging reinstated, but get this--the folks at Google Fi can't give you your account info if you can't authenticate with their app which is connected to your Google account!

It's been over a week since the account was suspended and I have made no progress. Has anyone out there made it through the bureaucracy and gotten their account reinstated? Any other ideas?"
techsupport,"Recently got Pornhub Premium which allows you to watch and **download** premium videos in 1440p and 4k. Downloaded a few and they're all over 1GB 4k VR .mp4 files. When playing them on my PC I can hear sound, but only see a blank screen with a distorted green line on the top and sometimes the entire screen turns green. Also the player starts freezing. Tried with both VLC and MPC-HC. It's like I'm downloading corrupted videos. 

I actually intended to use them on the Mobile VR Station app for use in a mobile VR headset, but they won't play there either showing a ""Cannot decode"" error. 

I hope someone can help me in this emergency!

&nbsp;

P.S. I tried playing some VR videos I've downloaded in the past both from Pornhub AND other sources and they all work fine.

P.P.S. on Windows 10 64bit.

#EDIT:

Ok, it looks like it's only the Mobile VR Station app on iOS that can't play the videos. They play perfectly fine on Windows using Windows's default video player and in VLC after disabling Hardware Encoding. Now I just need to find a better mobile app that can play these videos.

#EDIT 2:

I tried SKYBOX VR Video Player for iOS. Seems like a much better VR player, and it can actually play the videos, but sadly with a black screen and only audio."

techsupport,"About a month ago, my friend’s mom's computer was hacked and the hacker accessed all her and her aunt’s (who lives in Taiwan) financials. The hacker created pop ups and forms with fields for each to enter that were disguised as coming from Charles Schwab, where her mom's sister's bank is (her mom is holding the account on behalf of her sister).

Since then, the hacker has proceeded to take over her mom's computer, changing fonts, blacking out the screen, causing anything she wants to print to turn to Test prints, recording her mom's landline and cell phone conversations, interfering with those conversations any time they try to communicate something important. When her mom warned her friend on the landline that it was tapped/compromised and to call her cell phone at xyz number, her cell phone rang and the hacker played back a recording of her mom's voice telling her friend to call her cell phone. A computerized voice calls out her name in the middle of the day (not sure if it's coming from landline or her dad's computer or the TV - all connected via the same internet router).

The hacker has sent her mom text messages threatening to give her friends and family viruses. She took this as a physical threat because he said ""I'm yelling at you.""

As of yesterday, they disconnected everything and her dad signed up for a new cell phone and # but he received 5 text messages showing a yahoo verification trying to verify an account, but her dad doesn't have a yahoo account. She recommended they get a burner/throw-away phone to change their accounts, check their credit, etc.

They called the police who took a report. What else do they need to do?

Edit - Thank you for all of your help, I really appreciate all the detailed responses. I’ve sent her the thread (which she asked me to post) and I’ll update you when they find out what’s going on and get it sorted out."

techsupport,"Yesterday night I was playing a game on my laptop, paused the game and went out of the room for probably 10-15 minutes. When I came back, my mouse was moving on its on, the game was minimized on the start bar and the mouse was trying to save something in a steam directory, I didn't wait to see what they wanted to do and shut down my laptop and my router. Is it safe to assume that other laptos that share my router were infected as well? Is it safe to asume that the phones are compromised also? What shoud I do next to get rid of the problem?

Edit:
Thanks to all who replied and gave me good advice! I've acted on a couple of them. 
I made the edit to answer the most frequent questions and to give you an update.
 

- I had TeamViewer installed on my laptop, I instaled it a couple of weeks ago to help a friend with an issue.(I uinstalled it today) 
- The remote play feature for steam was not enabled.
- My mouse wasn't moving frantically, it moved with intent, fast and accurate, opened stuff (clicking) and trying to save something in steam. It couldn't be an issue with the mouse, the movements where accurate. It could't be my imagination either, the game was minimized when I came back, it was in full screen when I left it, another thing is that I saw the cursor moving with intent and precision, trying to save something for about 5-10 seconds I stayed there to watch just to be sure is not in my imagination or a mouse issue. 

As an update. I've talked with someone who has experience with this types of issues and he gave me a couple of things to do for now. I'll come back with new info as soon as I see some results."
techsupport,"Yesterday, my neighbour got on the machines BT and started ranting about her dirty ""V""(I'm also a woman btw). I was able to record her rant then let other people listen and they recognize her voice. I've been dealing with her being creepy and doing stalkery/obsessive things for a while(1-2 years). I couldn't really prove it 100% but now I have this recording with her voice and I want to let the property manager and police listen too.

Right now, I just need help with making the connection private and try to get a clear picture of the devices paired with the machine or it's history somehow.

I'm not extra tech savvy so I'm not sure what to do. I couldn't get in touch with the company for help because it was they closed for the weekend. I looked at the machines manual for information about making the connection private but there's not much info given. The manuals available online for anyone to see(Sole Fitness E35).

Sometimes when I try to connect to figure it out on my laptops bluetooth the machine just kicks me off because her Bluetooths connected like she set it to pair automatically before I can. I guess when she notices she's connected that's when she starts the nasty recording over and over again. I don't even bother working out on it. I just turn it off so I don't have to hear her."
techsupport,"I’m a 41yo Firefighter. I’m no “gamer” but I’ve owned several playstations and Xbox’s over the years and play mostly offline; Skyrim, fallout, red dead redemption 2, etc. My 9yo enjoys the video games much more than I do these days and that brings us up to the hack. 

The hacker wanted my PlayStation network game tag. A quaint 4 letter tag that would only be available if you’re old enough to have generated it many years ago on ps2. Apparently I blew him off when he tried to contact me, I say “him” but who knows, so now he has hacked and stolen the psn online name. Ok whatever, but he got ahold of a gmail and yahoo email in the process. 

Having those emails he was able harass me by changing passwords and settings on Netflix, Spotify etc. He gained no access to any financial info that I’ve found and he says he has no interest in that, oh yeah, we chat often. He messages me to see if I’ve changed my mind about paying his bitcoin ransom for the emails. 

So I’ve contacted all the credit cards and banks. Which, btw, I’ve found the best way to get ahold of a person at financial institutions is allowing a payment to go delinquent and at that point a real live person will call you! In any case, most all the changing passwords and securing accounts was time consuming but not difficult. That brings us to PlayStation network (Sony) and xboxlive (Microsoft). 

Between to two platforms I have downloaded content that I value over $2000. Games, movies, subscriptions etc. not including the cost of the systems themselves. All of which I am locked out of because the stolen email addresses are listed as contact and I can’t change passwords without PlayStation and Xbox sending the “change password” link to the guy who stole all my shit in the first place. 

All attempts to contact customer support at any of the involved companies(Microsoft, Sony, google, yahoo) is an utter disaster. Although yahoo did offer their account recovery tools for $9.99, which is the closest thing to “customer support” I’ve obtained from any of these modern marvels of the tech industry. 

I’m frustrated beyond the limits of my vocabulary and my 9yo is heartbroken. We were starting Halo 2 together and of course he doesn’t understand that we can’t play now because some neckbeard in his moms basement is having a laugh with our accounts. 

I’m not mad at the hacker, more annoyed, people like these don’t deserve the energy that anger requires. But I am absolutely infuriated by the disrespect with witch I’m treated by these companies that have pushed them selves into our daily lives. They promise security, they promise ease of use, they promise that they care for the people who purchase and use their products and they fulfill none of those promises. 

I won’t ramble any further. It seems at this point there’s not much left to do but write off the lose, learn the lesson and drive on.

techsupport,"So I was stuck on this and finally solved it 10 minutes ago after agonizing over it for days and wanted to share what my problem was in case others have the same problem. The problem sounds ridiculous but the solution made a lot of sense. 

I noticed whenever I used ""duplicate"", ""extend"", or ""second screen only"" for windows project (Windows key + p), my internet speed would slow down a lot. I'm downloading GTA V on Steam and could see the download speed go from 20MB/sec to 7MB/sec when switching to the second monitor, then it would go back to 20MB/sec after I switched to ""PC screen only"". I saw a similar decrease when testing speeds with Ookla. 

The solution was replacing the HDMI cable for my second monitor. I'm using wifi on my PC and apparently the old HDMI cable was probably causing interference. When I switched to a new HDMI cable (which seemed thicker and more shielded) I could use the second monitor without losing any speed on my download. 

Just to be sure, I switched back to the old cable and used the 2nd monitor, and still saw the decrease in speed. I went back to the new cable, and saw no decrease. 

The old HDMI cable was a really old cable from General Electric, and it kinda makes sense that it caused issues. 

Anyways I hope this post is helpful for those with a similar issue!"
techsupport,"So I'm in an online college course and I got a weird, vague email from the professor a few days ago claiming that I plagiarized. She threatened to report me to the dean of academics at my university (I'm taking the online class through the school I attend full-time). When I asked her what she was talking about she told me that I had uploaded another student's assignment with her name on it.

That was true, but it was an honest mistake on my part. The reason I even had another student's assignment on my hard drive was because we were supposed to upload our assignments to a forum, and the submission instructions included the sentence ""Post your assignment here so everyone can view your ideas"". The assignment was confusing, so I downloaded a PDF another girl in my class had already posted. Looking at her assignment helped me get started, and after I finished my assignment and exported it as a PDF I went to upload it to the forum. The girl's PDF had a similar name to mine so I accidentally uploaded hers instead of mine and here's where the shit show begins.

I sent an email to the professor apologizing and explaining that it was an honest mistake. I sent her my PDF that I had intended to turn in, provided a screenshot of the file's metadata showing that it had last been modified before the assignment's deadline, and even told her how to view the metadata for herself if she didn't believe me. Then she sent me another email telling me I'd still receive a zero on the assignment because I ""crossed a line"" by downloading another student's assignment and ""using it as a model"" for my own. Pissed, I emailed her back telling her (politely) that the submission directions literally told us to do exactly what she just described, and I quoted the exact sentence that encouraged us to do that verbatim. I sent the email and began texting a friend to tell them what happened, but when I looked back at the submission page for that specific assignment, the sentence I'd quoted was removed from the page completely. This was not even 10 minutes after I sent the email.

Anyway, I'm guessing she deleted the sentence so that she could deny the fact that it was ever included in the directions. I'm hoping I can somehow roll the site back at least a few hours so I can prove that she deleted it (rolling it back to yesterday or something would work too). I already checked, and the site was never archived on Wayback Machine. The forum in question is on my school's Moodle page, if that helps

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** professor accused me of plagiarism, I called bullshit, emailed her and quoted a sentence that was very important to my case from the course's website, she deleted it within a few minutes after I sent the email. Need to know if there's a way to look at previous versions of the site (other than Wayback Machine) or a recent archive of some sort

UPDATE: Thankfully the professor told me that she deleted the sentence to prevent further confusion and assured me that she wasn’t trying to hide something. Thanks for the help yall.

techsupport,"My sister is on holiday in Greece, I am in The Netherlands. We were just having a talk over the phone when we suddenly lost connection. My iPhone automatically reconnected and I immediately heard my sister talking. I asked “hey can you hear me?” and thought it was weird that she was telling me the exact same stuff she just told me.  Turns out I heard a one-sided recording of our conversation. I didn’t hear myself. It happened again when I hung up and called back. 

What is this?"
techsupport,"  

Late last year I noticed strange things happening on my computer, like browser tabs moving without my input and songs playing by themselves on iTunes, the mouse cursor would move by itself too. Then on my Android phone icons would move around by themselves, i'd also be browsing Reddit and the page would scroll down by itself when I was reading a post.

One time I got home and a video of a boxer training starting playing by itself on my Android phone when I got to my front door (and could reach wi-fi.) I'd have to open 2 folders on my Android phone to reach the video, then i'd have to play it. I remember I used the phone 30 minutes previous in town using the calculator to add up the price of my grocery bill, then I turned off the display. I did not go at the phone on the bus yet multiple folders were opened on the phone and a video started playing without my input. I remember one time talking to my cousin and I heard the sounds of phone numbers being pressed and a man mumbling in an odd fashion, neither me or my cousin didn't make that noise, I feel like we were being listened in.

   
 

I ended up getting rid of the computer because one day I opened up Firefox and saw ""4chan"" on the bottom left of the screen very briefly, like when you visit a website and the address pops up when you are connecting to that website. I looked at my hard drives under ""This PC"" and saw that my ""D"" drive, which previously had no files on it, had 6.3GB of data on it all of a sudden despite me downloading nothing to that drive. I felt like this person could have downloaded anything to my PC, like child porn for instance but because he had root access to my computer it would look the exact same to the authorities as me downloading it. I could get end up getting arrested over this stuff, I wouldn't be able to prove to the police that a hacker had done it. 

I ended up getting rid of the PC, the internet and the Android phone. I got a basic phone which has no internet since I thought i'd be less likely to be hacked. It is an Alcatel phone, but over the past months i've had ""Notification: Unknown Application"" appear on the screen of this basic phone, despite me having no access to the internet and the phone not having an App store. I also hear this clicking sound when I lock and unlock the phone despite me finding no option for enabling or disabling this sound in Settings. Draft messages get deleted at random too.

   
 I communicate with my cousin often and I feel like the hacker was able to send malware to his smartphone from mine, and when my cousin and & I sent texts to each other the hacker could somehow get access to my Alcatel phone (SOMEHOW) despite me having no internet and the phone not being a smartphone. 

I was thinking of getting the internet back on at home, getting a laptop and then formatting the hard drive whenever I notice suspicious activity but I read that malware can be installed on a router and you'd have to replace the route to get rid of the malware. Or what if my cousin visited and he connected to my wi-fi, the malware from his phone could infect my router. I am thinking of going to the Police since this person hacking my computer and phone is a crime but I read that hackers are practically invisible so I feel like this would be a waste, I feel like i'm being held hostage."

techsupport,"Yikes! Help! Okay, I suck with computes so please bear with me here as I slowly die inside.

SOO I had to download our wedding video from a Dropbox that was shared with me. I had 3 months to do it &amp; then it wouldn’t be able to access it. So my ass downloaded that video to ensure I didnt mess this up (July 2019) - played it / watched it all looked good! 

Knowing this laptop is old and unreliable, got back on (Dec 2019) and watched the video &amp; then decided to upload it to DropBox as a backup. Patting myself on the back for being responsible. 

My family’s been asking me to share the video, so I go on Dropbox to finally share it. I click in to watch it... only first 4 minutes, then buffering.. after 10 times decided to just get back on the old laptop where it is saved. 

Go to the file and watch - goes to 4 minutes and 17 seconds and then it just STOPS. Tried to go to the original downloaded one and it’s deleted? Did a search to find another version - all cut off at 4.17 minutes. Start checking to see if previous versions are available - see that yes! One has 2 previous versions! When tried to open the one from July 2019 says it is deleted... okay... try to open the one from December it’s the stupid 4 minute one again. And no it’s not in the recycle bin. 

The file is a mp4. Laptop is an old Lenovo Thinkpad. Windows 8.

Anyone know: 
1. What the hell I could have done? 
2. What else I can try? 
3. How to find a good professional I can take my laptop to to help?
3. Scale of 1-10, how f’ed am I?


Apologize if my explanation of what is going on is incoherent, trying my best to keep it together over here. Let me know what I need to clarify. 

Truly appreciate any help, insight or words of wisdom.

And if the case is that the video is irretrievable or my husband finds out...well...thoughts, prayers &amp; condolences are also welcomed.

EDIT:
One of the comments made me realize that I could have been watching the video from the folder it originally downloaded to in December. Before I uploaded to OneDrive, and I bet I moved (not copied) the file to another folder.... Possibly how the file got corrupted?


EDIT 2: 

Soo I’m getting a tiddle bit nervous that I’m going to mess more things up, so if my patience holds out, will pause for now and wait to see if I hear back from my videographer as many have suggested...either way will update asap with what the videographer said or with what success / failures I’ve had going through your suggestions below!!

*p.s. thank you all so much. I sincerely appreciate each one of you taking the time to reply. You are superheroes*


EDIT 3: 

GUYS! GOT MY WEDDING VIDEO BACK!!
Though I’m a little embarrassed by all the fuss I made, the Videographer did indeed reply with a link to re-download! Phew! 

You guys are AMAZING!!! Thank you so much for all of the help, advice &amp; words of wisdom! And for not making fun of me - Definitely feeling confident that I will not repeat this shameful event. 

Also, I’m still tempted to figure out what the hell happened to that first file so if I do ever figure it out, will definitely share the update *wouldn’t hold your breathe tho* 

I owe y’all big time! THANKS!

In my state, quarantine shut all the public schools down for basically the rest of the year— so I’ve been delegated to entertaining my son while cleaning the house. I’ve been fairly sleep deprived lately.

I spent 20 minutes looking for it and found it with my son’s paw patrol action figure game. His explanation was that Rocky wanted a Nintendo switch.

Then all of the YouTube videos she had uploaded were deleted as well as all her subscriptions. Also all the google drive was deleted. 

We changed the password multiple times and also had a 2fa on of phone sign in and then we even tried the Authenticator app. Even changing the password didn’t help they always were able to remain having access. 

On the last hours before deleting the entire google account they were using the  YouTube and changing its pic and cover pic to photos from my google photos.

techsupport,"So I was playing gtaV online tonight and was messing with people as normal when one of the guys I killed called me a rude name and shared my ip in the chat. This didn’t really bother me, because I know your ip isn’t hard to find. I ignored him until he said that I was using Comcast and named the state I live in. Shortly after this, he gave a cynical “bye bye” in chat and I was kicked from the game. 

I closed the game to make sure it wasn’t just my internet connect, only to find that all the devices in my house had lost connection to the internet. I immediately called my ISP and they got to work trying to fix it. After hanging up with them, my internet was back up and running. For about 2 minutes, that is, when suddenly I was unable to open any tabs on my computer again. 

At this point I was a bit confused, so I did some of my own research while on the phone with ISP again. I couldn’t find any information pertaining to my situation, just a lot of blogs about what ddossing is and how it’s such a big deal now. So my ISP “fixed” the problem again and I was fine for another couple of minutes when everything stopped working again. 

Now I’m here. I don’t know what to do. I have an online training for my work tomorrow morning and I’m going to have to cancel because this pos decided to DDoS me.

Summary of this I've been depressed for a long time it has recently gotten worse because I broke up with my gf a few months ago and my dad was recently diagnosed with leukemia and is going to die soon. Mom asked me why I didn't have anyone to go out with this weekend (I had been dating a girl and going out with her on weekends but she ghosted me all of a sudden) and then when I told my mom that I didn't have anyone to go out with she said something like ""oh are you guilting her into hanging out with you by saying your going to kill yourself"" Which is obviously a super weird thing to say without knowing anything. No I don't guilt people or force them to do anything by threatening suicide..But I had been talking to people about my feelings and suicide so maybe that's why mom would have brought it up if she had been seeing my texts. Thanks to the people who reached out and talked to me but I really do have people I can talk to already.  I'm really never going to kill myself unless some really bad stuff happens to me all at once; for now I want to live long enough to see sum aliens LMAO(really though I know I will be happy one day, I want to have a family and a beautiful wife one day). I would also like to defend my mom I guess I made her out to be a crazy lady but she is my best friend and favorite person in the world and I kind of doubt she would be spying on me in the first place although she is a very nosy person...I think its possible that she just knows so much about me, she is my mom after all, that she could just tell I have been depressed since she knows I have a lot going on and was just worried about me.

I heard video recordings of hers and then conversations I was having with her and my sister this same day, and a phone call with my boyfriend that I had downstairs not long before plugging the usb in. 

I've never given my father access to my phone, and my mother hasn't either. I have a galaxy note 9 and she has some sort of newer iPhone. 

Again, I am not tech savvy, but I have no idea how this happens or how to get around it and if he is capable of this sort of thing when I'm at my own place. I would bring it up to him but that is between him and my mother. In the meantime, if it is my phone, how do I counteract this?

Edit: Wow!! I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I am going to be taking some time to reply and implement all of the advice I've received. Thank you guys so much for your insight and help and kindness."
techsupport,"My brother slapped his hand on the top of my PC case while I was using it. Then everything froze, I tried to restart it but I only heard strange beeping noise from the PC case and it won't turn on. I disassembled my PC and put everything back together but it won't start up. Any advices?"

techsupport,"Hi. I'm writing it here cause I don't know any better subreddit for this stuff. When I was little (about 10 or so. I'm 22 now) I was sitting in front of my computer and browsing some shit. I was living with my mom and grandpa but my mom wasn't home at the time. It was quite late. Suddenly, I remember that my screen started turning bloody red, the windows that were opened started to close themselves. The wallpaper went black or red (I don't remember exactly) and what was the weirdest shit - my icons started slowly falling down the screen and dissapearing. After that I think some loud noise started coming out of my headphones and my monitor started showing some glitchy, creepy stuff. I was freaked out and started crying. Franticly run to my grandpa's room and told him about it. when we came to my room my screen was just red (nothing else was happening and I think my grandpa didn't really believed me what just happened). Then he did something (I guess he just forcefully turned the computer off), told me not to worry about it and that I can now turn it on again. I've NEVER seen anything like this before or after that. I couldn't turn on my computer for about a week. I was too terrified. After that, everything was fine and it didn't happen ever again.

So my question is. Does anyone know what the fuck this was or ever experienced something similar?"

techsupport,"I'm stupid and everyone treats me like I'm stupid and they're right to. I wasn't raised with good tech and anytime I've been given tech I'm left alone to figure out how it works, with no help. My father gave me an older laptop that he bought from his company a few years ago. I have windows 10. It's not the best laptop, it has broken keys and burns like the sun. But it's all I have. It's my only escape.  I'm mentally falling apart because of how my life is right now which leads me to make short term decisions out of frustration and sadness. I just wanted a moving background. I couldn't get it to work so I downloaded something called repaper. Well I fucked it up and shouldn't have downloaded it to begin with because windows tried telling me not to and I did anyway. Well, it won't do what it's supposed to and I can't delete it because it claims it's ""open in another file"" but it's fucking not. It put a moving background that looks sucky in my desktop background but that's it, and I managed to get it down. I'm so angry at myself. I'm afraid I just downloaded malware or a virus and it has yet to show. Why won't it let me delete it? Am I just too dumb to realize I'm glossing over something? I wish I knew how things work. I'm sorry I can't figure this out by myself."
techsupport,"I rent a room in a house. I have no access to the WiFi router, but have the password to use it. I’m pretty sure my landlord is stalking me online. He knows things and says things that only someone who is familiar with my internet clicks and interactions could know. My guess is that because I use the WiFi, he is able to track where I go online. He would be able to guess my main Reddit account, for example. 

How do I make my web browsing more private? Hopefully this is a really naive question with a stupidly simple answer.

I don’t know the specs on the router.

techsupport,"My internet fluctuates between 200KB/s and 1MB/s however it is effectively around 400-500KB/s. Without fail, whenever I load up a speed test site, the speed doesn't fluctuate, even when doing it multiple times one after another, and I get the 10mbps I pay for. 
It's been at least a year now but when I had called tech support about an issue I can't remember now, when they asked me to do a speed test, as soon as I said I was ready, my download I had running in the background suddenly spiked to around 18mbps and stayed there until I told the person helping me the speed test was finished. 

I know naturally they'd throttle to my speed limit but I want to know if there's any way I can prove what I mentioned in the title. Another thing to note is that when upgrading plans to get better speed, somehow the same fluctuation patterns seemed to happen but scaled to my new speed cap.

I've had other issues with them and I can't really switch because they are basically the only ISP where I live. They have other issues that really bug me but they just brush it off as ""interference"" or ""a problem with the servers I'm connecting to"" when I know for a fact it's not."
techsupport,"Solved: https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater Sped up my laptop immensely, as did limiting background updats to 5% bandwidth usage, installing all required updates and restarting, and disabling as many start up programs as I could. As for why school and library potato-spec machines run so well, I'm pretty sure enterprise builds do most of this by default and a lot of work is offloaded by a server.

Without fail, I can go into a school or library and power on their DDR2 machines with Core 2 chips and 320GB 3.5"" Hard drives, integrated graphics, and they run windows 10 so well.

Meanwhile my AMD A9 9425 Laptop with 4GB of DDR4 and HDD runs windows 1000x worse.

techsupport,"I work at a business that is located in a strip mall and over the last few years, I've noticed that there is an insane amount of wireless networks all with excellent signal strength, usually between -40 to -55dBm.  What got me suspicious is that these wireless networks are almost all clones of customers and staff WiFi SSID's, including mine and even friends and family who have come into my place of work.  I felt something was amiss but I didn't feel confident in trying to solve it, so I just never really looked into it any further.  However, I had an itch to check it out again recently and used a WiFi analyzer on my phone to see if I could discover anything and I'm fairly certain that what's going on is a honeypot operation.

Viewing the analyzer, all the rogue networks have the same MAC address and interestingly, one of the SSID's is called ""Pineapple\_XXX"" with the X's representing the 6th octet of the MAC address all the rogue networks have (Note: It's not actually XXX, but I'm just currently paranoid so I didn't want to put the actual octet).  I decided to look up what a pineapple was and it turns out, it's a pentest tool used to test network vulnerabilities.  The company that makes them is called Hak5 and upon reviewing their devices, it seems it's a pretty popular and relatively easy to use tool to exploit networks.

Against my better judgement, I attempted to sign into one of the networks and was greeted with a Facebook login I needed to do before getting access to the network.  I don't have Facebook and even if I did, I wouldn't put my actual credentials in, so I just put in some random bullshit and surprise surprise, it gave me access to the network.  I then went to google to check my public facing IP and it was different than the IP I recorded when I was my work WiFi.  I should note that I shut off mobile data for this to make sure it wasn't just pulling my mobile IP but for the sake of transparency, I checked my mobile IP several different times and it always had the same network part, different than the IP I pulled from the rogue network.  Upon looking up the IP address, I find out the provider is AT&T (SBC) which is not the provider my work has (we have Comcast Business).  Tonight, I had time to get a good look around to see if there were any devices I could spot that might be the source, even took a good look up in the ceiling panels to make sure there were no devices up there, but I couldn't find anything.  I'm of course assuming this thing is plugged in for how long it's been operating.

I obviously can't confirm this is a honeypot, but I feel all the indicators are there.  I did some signal strength testing and it gets stronger the closer I get to the wall of the adjacent business.  One final thought; there was a network that showed up and continues to show up called ""kali"" and upon looking that up, it turns out it's a Linux distro specifically designed for pentesting.  This can't all just be some big coincidence, can it?

Edit: Thanks everyone.  It seems the most common advice is to contact the building owner/managment along with different law enforcement agencies.  I'll see where that takes this.  Thanks again!"
techsupport,"Hello. My little siblings have been addicted to fortnite for the past 6 months and it’s getting way out of hand now that I need to study for my upcoming SAT’s. Combined they play over 8 hours daily. I want to block Fortnite on the computer. I was thinking of removing permissions from all users to Epic Games Launcher and then setting the Launcher to Hidden, but after testing with other applications it seems you can just re install the application. I either need to block the epicgames url from the browser so they can not re download Epic Games after i remove permissions and set to hidden, or find a more permanent way to block the application without it being able to be reinstalled from the website.

Thank you guys so much for the help in advance this has been a big problem that I can’t seem to solve 🙏

Edit: Woah just checked this post after a couple hours thanks for all the feedback. I ended up trying to block Epic Games via the firewall but for some reason it wouldn’t work. I knew i was doing it right because other apps i tried it on actually became blocked. So I messed around with all the permissions and now Epic Games doesn’t even open when I click it and when I try to re download it says insufficient permissions. So basically it worked but I have no idea how to fix it in case I need to. Parents haven’t found out but lets just say when they do OP might be getting a spanking ⚰️☠️

P.S. to all you guys who say talk it out and make an agreement i’ve obviously tried but nothing works. Might seem crazy but my parents would rather let siblings play than I study to stop them from whining"

techsupport,"I don't exactly know if this is the best place to post this, but I have no idea where else I would do it. (if you have a better sub ill delete this and post it elsewhere)

Firstly, I wouldn't even consider myself inept with technology, I know and can prevent a fair amount I believe, but apparently I've been outsmarted.

Heres the parameters:

To connect to their wi-fi, you must first give them your technology device for a few minutes, and then you'll be put on the wifi. They usually grab whatever information they need from the system information tab. I'm assuming their just taking the wi-fi address, which I'm also guessing is the way they're able to track me, but I'm not all-too sure.

My school can track whatever I'm doing on my laptop (MacBook pro 2018), realtime, record a screen capture and then notify the teacher within a matter of minutes. It doesn't sound all that crazy, but here's the catch.

\- a VPN of any sort has had no effect

\- they can monitor you outside of web searches and wifi-related tasks

\- they can monitor within web searches and wifi-related tasks.

\- they can track you offline (I had turned off my wifi in order to start doing some trial and error, and I had opened up my messaging app whilst offline, and then closed in before I even had it open for 10 seconds. I was still told that they had seen me open up a messaging app

\- This only occurs in one class; a study hall.

\- It is not a security camera in real life

Lastly, is there any way to prevent them from being able to track me? Thank you.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all of the advice guys. On Monday I have the class again, and I will make sure to troubleshoot some more. I'm going to try spoofing my mac address, and see if I am confronted, and ill make sure to keep you guys posted. I'm sure theres a deeper issue here, but I need to start off with the more feasible options before I wipe my hard drive and install the macos again. 

Regarding something being secretly installed on my device, it would most certainly have to be done remotely because all the times I have handed over my device I was watching what they were doing; i.e. making sure they weren't plugging in usb drives, downloading things, etc. The only thing they seemed to have written down was my (I think) mac address. I will be spoofing it when I got into school on monday."

We are very causal with our internet use, causal gaming and using our laptops and junk. Our 4th roomate is an avid PC gamer, spent several thousand dollars on equipment and what not, and he is able get speeds of 800mbs per second download on his PC and on his IPhone. I’m concerned because none of us in the house are able to obtain these speeds. He bought a Net-gear Nighthawk and set it up himself, is it possible he prioritized all of his devices leaving us shit speeds? 

Hope this makes sense, my tech knowledge is very surface level.

UPDATE: First of all thank you for all the help, this has been a real frustrating situation.

Roomate did a hard reset on the router and then ran a speed test on his phone that was getting roughly 15mbps and it shot up to 130mbps. He has an older iPhone 6s, don’t know how much that would effect signal strength, but still a massive improvement. What does this mean in our situation? Can we confirm we has throttling our internet for his use?

UPDATE #2: After the hard reset of the router the hardwired PS4 speeds went from 60mbps to 230mbps."

techsupport,"So, about 20 or 30 minutes ago, in the middle of streaming something from my computer, my 32"" E-series Vizio smart TV began ""searching for available updates"" and then ""loading"" and then starting over again seconds later, repeating on a loop without end. The video continued to play for a few minutes, but eventually stopped. The ""searching"" has not stopped. I've turned it off and on, restarted the modem/router, and looked through the TV's settings trying to find a way to turn off automatic updates to no avail. 

I'm at a loss here, and my TV is now completely worthless whenever it's connected to the internet. The searching constantly interrupts everything that I'm doing, even just going into the menu. Even if I could get an app running the ""searching"" bar constantly popping up on the bottom of the screen makes watching anything insufferable.

Anyone experienced this problem before or have an idea what might be happening? 


edit: Not sure what the status is on this issue, or if people are still coming across it, but I figured I should include some of the fixes that have cropped up since this post is coming up in google searches and what not.

For those using wireless connection: Go into Menu > Network > WPS. Once your television begins the WPS connection process, cancel out of it. This disconnects you from the network. Now reconnect to your network of choice (you will have to retype your password). This should stop the searching. It worked for me and many others.

For those using wired connection: Haven't used this myself, but others have reported success. Unplug the ethernet cable from your tv, then attempt to connect to a wireless network and cancel out of it. Now reconnect the ethernet cable. That should be it.

Thanks to unstoppablenow, ChiefDarunia and others for posting about these workarounds."

I think it's possible there's something else too.

**Update 2:** Monkeys are back. Found another copy under ""C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.4\Doc\EULA.jpg"" instead of ""\Intel\download.jpg"". Restarted after deleting and we're good so far. One was in startup and the other in task scheduler. Unless there's something else in that script you guys see, it looks like that's all folks.

    Dim shell : Set shell = CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"")
    Dim wallpaper : wallpaper = ""C:\Intel\download.jpg""
    Set oSHApp = CreateObject(""Shell.Application"")
    
    Do While True

techsupport,"Years ago, my father in law  acquired an unbelievably large stack of refurbished SCSI HDDs, by what means I am uncertain. He intended to sell them, but tragically passed away before getting around to it. Now I’m left trying to figure out what to do with them. 

The problem lies in the fact that in evaluating them and searching the web for the model numbers, I’ve found that they range from $10-$120 a piece. Yet they are fairly old and I’m not sure I could find someone interested. 

These are all factory refurbished, sealed, and in boxes ready for shipping, by the way.

Part of me wants to cut my losses (technically my late father in law’s losses) and scrap them, but I’d hate to miss out on selling them to someone that could use them. 

Advice?

Here are the model numbers:

Seagate Barracuda ST15150N
Seagate Barracuda ST118273LC
Seagate Cheetah ST118202LC

I'm planning on doing a fresh install of Windows soon and I was wondering if you guys had your own sort of checklist you went through after reinstalling Windows. So far I got:

* Motherboard Drivers
* Download Chrome
* Graphics Drivers
* Use Ninite for common apps
* Reinstall everything else
* Disable Cortana
* Disable web search

Sort of kicking myself for not keeping track of the changes I made so my system throughout the year, but thanks in advance to anyone with any ideas."
techsupport,"So my computer makes a very quiet sound when turned off but still plugged in, so I'm thinking I could unplug it every night and plug it back in in the mornings, but could this be damaging in any way? Also, should i unplug the power cord that attaches to the computer or should i unplug the socket? Which one is better to avoid tear or damage?

Edit: SOLVED! Thank you so much to everyone who tried to help, I really appreciate it. It turns out I’m just stupid and didn’t even think to try waiting a bit after turning of the PSU, but when I tried waiting like 1-2 min the sound disappeared. I also leaned in closer and could clearly hear that it was coming from the cable, so it was definitely coil whine. For anyone with the same issue, just flip the PSU switch from 1 to 0 and wait like 1-2 min. 
I can finally sleep now!"
techsupport,"As stated in the title. This has just happened, we are trying to figure it out. My wife and I were laying in bed together, scrolling Reddit. I closed the app and saw she had sent me a text. I asked why, and she said she was responding to my text. I absolutely did not text her anything. She has a Samsung S9. Her thread looks like this:

1:28 (from me) Love you...

1:28 (from her) I love you.

1:36 (from me) Lies!

MY thread looks like this (IPhone 8)

1:28 (from her) I love you.


And that’s it. I got her message, but someone else very clearly sent her two messages within our text thread. What’s even creepier is that those are definitely things I would say, but there isn’t an instance of me saying exactly that anywhere on my phone. I also wouldn’t use the fragment “Love you...”, as I use full sentences.

techsupport,"Don't know if this is the right place to post this... but here's a horror story for people considering Lenovo.  After three unsuccessful warranty repair attempts for an acknowledged factory defect in their display, **Lenovo disposed of my laptop, won't replace it, and will only refund me half of what I paid for it.** 

Get a quick overview in this [imgur album](http://imgur.com/gallery/UJfkx) or read on for a lengthy timeline of the whole saga.  With pictures!

**April 30th, 2014** – I bought a sweet new refurbished[ Lenovo Thinkpad Laptop](http://i.imgur.com/xPnNqGE.jpg) through Amazon.  I love Thinkpads and have been using them since before they were Lenovo.  Hurray!

It was sold through an Amazon marketplace third party but despite being refurbished, it specifically says it has a full factory warranty.

**July 23rd, 2014** – My laptop starts having ghosting/image retention issues.  It is a very common issue on the [forums](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-Edge-S-series/Thinkpad-Yoga-ghosting-after-image-watermark-issue/td-p/1412737).   Lenovo has no official solution and mine is still tolerable during every day use, so I wait.

**November 4th, 2014** – Lenovo officially [acknowledges that there is a defect in their hardware.](http://i.imgur.com/cv6iznl.jpg)  Some users have been reporting that the replacement panel also shows symptoms of ghosting, but Lenovo denies it.

**November 24th, 2014** – My display has [deteriorated quite a bit](http://i.imgur.com/ncaIKCe.jpg) so I call Lenovo tech support.  They are very friendly and overnight me a box to ship my laptop in to the service depot for a screen replacement.

**December 2nd, 2014** – I receive my laptop back.  They have replaced the display with the updated panel.  A quick test shows very mild image retention still, but it is much improved.  However, now there are [two dead areas in the touch screen](http://i.imgur.com/BzctX5Q.jpg) that don't respond.  One of them is right over the start button.  Several other people [have this issue in the forums.](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-Edge-S-series/ThinkPad-Yoga-touchscreen-dead-spots-on-lower-corners/m-p/1728329)

**December 3rd, 2014** – Called back tech support.  They are not quite as together this time but ship me another box to send my laptop in again.   I send it in December 9th.

This time they hold onto it for a week. The status says “Hold for customer information” instead of “Repairing” but support assures me that's just a placeholder and that they don't need more information from me.

**December 17th, 2014** – I get an email saying the repair was complete and the laptop was shipped back to me.  UPS tracking shows the laptop was delivered to North Carolina somewhere.  I live in California.

Here's what the nice lady on support chat said:

> **Tiffany**  
> Per David O****** sending machine to lenovo for investigation. SBU  
> You should recieve a call for a posible replacement.
> 
> **Me**  
> do you have a number I should call?

> **Tiffany**  
> They will contact you.  
> Is there anything else I can help you with?
> 
> **Me**  
> Will they contact me today do you think?
> 
> **Tiffany**  
> maybe not today unsure.  
> Is there anything else I can help you with?
> 
> **Me**  
> So there's no ETA on when the laptop will be repaired or replaced at all?

> **Tiffany Snadon**  
> NO  
> You will be contacted the just recieved the machine it's a process.  
> Is there anything else I can help you with?
> 
> **Me**  
> Okay  
> That's all, thanks 

**December 19th, 2014** - Still haven't heard anything.  I call Lenovo customer service.  Same number I've always used.  The guy says that he doesn't do Thinkpad support, but he'll transfer me.  He transfers me, I wait on hold, another man answers.  He says he's in Ideapad support and doesn't do Thinkpad support.  I tell him I was just transferred here BECAUSE he did Thinkpad support.  He's like nope, let me transfer you back to Thinkpad support.  He hangs up instead of transferring me.

I call Thinkpad support again.  The lady on the phone is baffled and calls the support depot for me.  We wait on hold for about 30 minutes, finally the support depot answers.  The customer support lady hung up at some point during the wait and is no longer on the line.  Whatever.  The support depot says  ""yeah we sent it off to engineering, someone should have contacted you.""  I was like ""no one contacted me.""  they were like ""huh!"" then they gave me the number of the guy they sent it to.  I call, but no one answers.  I call back the support depot, wait on hold for 20 more minutes, then explain the situation again.  They use phrases like “this is so weird” and “I've never seen this before!”  She calls Lenovo HQ for me, and eventually comes back and says that the guy who has my laptop is one of their top engineers but he's out of the office for the day already.  It is...  1:16pm.  They have no idea what he's doing with it or when I will get it back.

Right after I hang up, amusingly, FedEx knocks on my door and delivers my laptop back to me.  I open it up.  It is exactly the same, same screen ghosting, same dead spots in the touch screen, and also now the [covers that hide the screws are missing.](http://i.imgur.com/sUBsOkR.jpg)

I call back Technical support, explain the whole situation.  Since they have tried twice to repair and only made things worse, I ask for a replacement laptop or for a repair tech to come to my location instead of sending it to their depot (a service they offer for more expensive warranties.)  They refuse.  The lady says she will escalate this to their “top techs” this time.  I explain that it was already sent to their “top engineer” at Lenovo HQ and still wasn't fixed.  She says she can't do anything except put a note on it for the service depot to escalate it.  I ask why that didn't already happen after they didn't fix it the first time.  She says she's positive they will fix it this time if it is escalated.  I ask what happens if they don't, she says then they would discuss a replacement but she's positive it won't come to that.

**December 23rd, 2014** – They've had my laptop a few days, the status is back at “Hold for customer information.”  I'm also not getting email confirmations this time for some reason.  I call the service depot, wait on hold, and finally ask if they need any more information from me.  They say no.  I ask why I'm not getting emails.  She says that no email address is listed for me, even though they had my email the last two times.  I ask her to add one, she says she can't modify service requests, only view them.  Great.

At some point after the first failed repair I filled out one of those [“How are we doing” automated surveys](http://i.imgur.com/u2sETmT.jpg) regarding their customer support, and later that afternoon, a Customer Satisfaction Advocate emails me.  I reply within 20 minutes explaining the whole situation.  She [replies](http://i.imgur.com/SNykhU4.jpg) immediately:

> I am out of the office until 12/24/2014.
 
> I will respond to your message when I return.

She never responded.  Hilarious.

**December 29th, 2014** – I receive a call from a new guy in escalations asking me to call him.  I call him back twice, no answer.

**December 30th, 2014** – I call him back again.  He asks why I called.  I said...  he left me a message asking me to, and I was just checking on the status of my laptop.  He says he doesn't know but he will contact the service depot.

**January 2nd, 2015** – Haven't heard anything.  Call back escalation guy.  The second time I call, he answers, says he hasn't heard anything, but he will email the service depot manager.

**January 5th, 2015** – Haven't heard anything.  Call back the escalation guy.  He says they can't fix my laptop, but someone should contact me about a replacement.

**January 12th, 2015** – Haven't heard anything.  Get a call from escalations guy.  He asks if I'd been trying to call him, because they changed his number.  He says the service depot has said they can't repair my laptop but they haven't officially marked that down on the service request yet.  Lenovo can't proceed with a replacement until they officially say they cannot repair it.  He says he will email them again.

**January 13th, 2015** – I miss a call from a new Customer Advocacy Case Manager in the morning.  I call her back and she doesn't answer. Over the next few days, I call several more times.

**January 15th, 2015** – Finally get a hold of her.  She says because my laptop was purchased through a third party vendor, they can't replace it, but they can refund me what I paid for it.  She has to request a refund, confirm the amount, and then money is coming from China so it will take a couple weeks.  I tell her they've had my laptop for months and ask if there are any other options, she says no.  This is the first I'm hearing about the ""can't replace laptops sold through third parties"" rule.  She says she just needs me to ship my laptop back to them to get the process started.  I tell her that it is... still in the their repair center.  Where it's been for months.  She's like “oh good that will speed things up!”

**January 16th, 2015** – I [emailed the customer advocate lady back](http://i.imgur.com/uzolegt.jpg) (she specifically told me to email her since she was too busy with customers to answer the phone.)  I explained I had been thinking about her refund offer and decided I thought it was unfair.  Even if I got my full purchase price back, because I got a deal on it originally, it wouldn't be enough money to replace it with the exact same model without spending additional money out of pocket.  I requested a replacement of my exact same laptop, if not the newer version that was just announced that would presumably fix this hardware issues.  If that wasn't possible, at least a discount on a new laptop that would bring it down to the $1400 I paid originally, especially considering the length of time this had taken and the fact that it was a known hardware issue in the first place exacerbated by the service department.

She never replied.  She also never contacted me to confirm anything.

**January 27th, 2015** – I receive a check from Lenovo for $864.06.  I originally paid $1399.99 for my laptop.  I call back the customer advocate, she doesn't answer.  I call the escalation guy at the depot, he tells me to send him my original receipt and he will forward it along.

**January 28th, 2015** – The customer advocate rep calls me back.  I recorded it, but in summary she says that they only refund the amount that Lenovo was paid for the laptop, not the amount I paid, and they won't replace the machine because it was refurbished.  Literally she claims if I bought a Lenovo laptop at Best Buy that they couldn't repair they would only refund me what Best Buy paid for it.  

I say I never would have accepted a refund had I known it would be for half of what I paid for it.  She maintains my only option is to go back to the original vendor.  I tell her fine, send me back the laptop so I can return it to Amazon.  She says she will email the service depot to see if they even still have it.

I ask for a discount on a new one, she offers me a 15% discount.  That would make a new laptop of the exact same model cost roughly $1500, which is more than the $1400 I paid originally and much more than the only $860 I have now.

She tells an unrelated story about a lady in Afghanistan who bought a Lenovo laptop off eBay and received one that had been opened and parts swapped out.  She claims in my case that they can't prove that Lenovo caused the issue, because maybe my seller modified the laptop before I got it.  I say that's ridiculous because it's a known hardware issue in this model and also the *service depot* caused the second issue.  She says she is ""baffled"" that I never got an email about the refund price.

She claims the seller lied about it coming with a new factory warranty, even though their own refurb factory outlet specifically says all computers come with a full factory warranty.  She promises to send me the warranty information but never does.

She refuses to believe the service depot made the issue worse after the first repair. Exact quote: ""They're in the service of fixing your computer, why would they break something?""

Anyway.  I continued our communication with emails, to get things in writing. 

You can read the whole [email chain here](http://i.imgur.com/g6IfBRW.jpg), but some select quotes:

> **Me**  
> Are you saying if I bought a Lenovo laptop from Best Buy, and it had a hardware defect that couldn't be repaired by the service depot, Lenovo wouldn't replace the machine and would only refund the amount Best Buy originally paid Lenovo for the laptop?

> **Lenovo**  
>We would only refund you the price Best Buy purchased our machine from us

and

> **Me**  
>Can you show me these policies somewhere?  Because as I said in my first email the outlet website specifically states the laptops come with a standard warranty and... Doesn't make any mention of only replacing refurbished with refurbished or similar.

> **Lenovo**  
> These are internal policies.

Anyway, of course the service depot had already scrapped my laptop, so they can't return it, and won't pay me more than $860 for a refund that I never agreed to in the first place.

Her final email:

> As already stated, we will not be giving you any further compensation for your machine that was purchased from a third party vendor.   Buyer beware.


TL;DR Buyer beware indeed.

techsupport,"So I got a call this morning because a tech guy wants to come in my house to check my network setup (I'm using Cable Internet). He says I'm affecting the neighborhood's network somehow.

I'm an IT Tech and a web dev. I never heard such a thing, especially since I use THEIR modem, plugged in an Archer C7 router There's only one ethernet cable used for a physical PC and a Linksys Powerline adapter plugged into the router, the rest is all Wi-Fi. The setup couldn't be more simple.

Is it legit? What could be causing issues ?

Edit: I should rephrase: It's legit, because it's the real ISP number and everything... I'm just confused as to how I can be the cause of that kind of problem... I can't create a loop in their VLANs or anything (at least, not the way I'm setupped).

##**EDIT2:** Turns out the coax was the issue. We moved it about 2 inches, tightened the connector/coupler and it fixed the problem (I also gained ~10% performance on various speed tests)."
techsupport,"In a rush while packing up to sell my house and move cross county, all my brilliance left my head. I was trying to get a fresh start in a new state. In the process of downsizing I gave all my computers away and just held onto a few laptops and all my harddrives. I was getting ready I began transfering data from my old Windows 7 HTPC into my 4 bay QNAS. Well time caught up with me and in a paniced state I pulled all the laptops and bagged them along with nicly wrapping the HDD. I land in Florida, ready with my cheap USB to HDD cases and a ton of drives. Of course the first thing that  I realize as I plug that drive into a laptops USB port that it could not access any of the data. Disc Manger says it is not formatted as a MBR drive, but instead I had formatted it as a GPT. The laptop will not read it, if I plug it into the USB port on the NAS it shows it as a unknown file type. I don't want to and can't afford to build a cheap system just to transfer the data over.

Any ideas?"
