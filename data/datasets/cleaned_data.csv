24hoursupport,"        As of ( Microsoft is officially finished supporting Windows XP.          Why it's important for you to upgrade now  If you are still using XP, or know of people who are it's time to upgrade them (and yourself)!  Microsoft will no longer be supplying updates and security patches. Those who create infections have been stockpiling XP vulnerabilities for months because if they wait for MS to drop support then they can use them forever, versus infecting machines now with these tricks and Microsoft patching XP to prevent those tricks from working in the future.  Also XP was released in 2001, and has well run it's course, now with 3 consumer operating systems from Microsoft having been released.  New hardware won't support XP, and neither will new software (Office 2013 for example won't run on XP or Vista). When Microsoft stops supporting XP, it will be a very short time before everyone else stops as well.      What if I use ""X"" software to protect me from infections  There are a lot of good protection softwares out there. One of the most popular amongst this community is Microsoft Security Essentials, which will also cease working on April 1st, 2014 (for XP machines).  Even if you have great protection software, it's still something that is added on TOP of your operating system, and if there are holes in your OS, infections will still be able to get in. 3rd party companies aren't going to be able to patch all the security issues in XP, and they'll only support XP for as long as there is a market. And it should be noted that XP's market share has been dropping fast and will continue to do so. Don't be one of the stragglers still hanging on past April 1st.      Where to go  Windows Vista, 7, 8, Linux, etc. are all available as upgrade paths. I personally would recommend Windows 7, as it has a good upgrade path from XP and currently has the largest market share of any Operating System. Meaning, much like XP, it will likely have a very long line of support. I figure if you stuck with XP for this long, you'll probably want something you can also stick with for as long as you can.  Other options exist and if you're interested you can discuss them in the comments below.

This means everything will be wiped clean, so you should back up all the data on your computer that you want to keep. Even if you do an OS Upgrade, there's still a chance your data could be lost (about 1 in 10 from the hundreds I've done for regular household computers). And you should be backing up your data regularly anyways.  The easiest route will likely be to get an external hard drive, copy everything you want to keep over to it, and then unplug the external drive before wiping your computer and installing the new OS.  For more information on data backup see our wiki page:   (#wiki_different_ways_of_backing_up_data_and_keeping_it_safe.3A)      Compatibility and the difference between 32-Bit and 64-Bit  If you use older software, it may not be compatible with newer operating systems. This is always the case. Fortunately the vast majority of software that worked on XP will also work on Vista/7/8. So you shouldn't have much to worry about, but if you have any truly ancient software, now is the time to find a replacement.  Something many people are confused about when transitioning from XP to a newer operating system is the difference between 32 and 64-bit. So I'm going to clear it up so you'll understand what is best for you.   32-Bit: This is what computers used for the longest time. Back in the 80's when computers were considered powerful if they had 4 MB of RAM (roughly the size of one MP3), they started using 32-Bit systems. They knew that it would work great for a long time, because it had a max of 4 GB (or 4,096 MB). And it did last for a long time. But we got to a point where we were producing 4GB sticks of RAM relatively cheap and needed to change to something that could see all of the RAM and be able to use it.  64-Bit: This is what we gradually transitioned to from around 2004 to now. It can see below 4GB, just like 32-bit, and above to virtually any RAM amount that will exist in your lifetime (17,592,186,044,416 MB). To put that number in perspective, if each one of those MBs was equal to one second, then that would be roughly 35,000 years. 35,000 years ago was when neanderthals went extinct. So, it's a pretty big number. Which is why we're switching all our computers over to it. The only downside is that since it is so different, some programs won't work with it that would work on a 32-bit machine. Again, these are mostly programs from the 1990's, and before, but some newer ones may have issues too. But since we've been doing this 64-Bit thing for about a decade now, you're not as likely to run in to too many issues. So unless you absolutely have to use a program made for Windows 95, and refuse to find a replacement, you should go with 64-Bit to take advantage of having access to more RAM.      If you have questions regarding upgrading from XP to another OS that still has support, ask them below. This post will be pinned so the community will be here to help those making the switch.      TLDR: XP is getting dropped by Microsoft meaning infections will run rampant on it. Back up your data and upgrade to Windows 7, or something else with long term support.

Android,"I know the title is rather sensational, however it couldn't get any closer to the truth.  For those who are too busy to read the whole post, here's the TL;DR version: The   storage scanner in the Device Care section is made by a super shady   Chinese data-mining/antivirus company called Qihoo 360. It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it (unless using ADB or other means).  This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on ( and (  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.  For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.  If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line ""powered by 360"". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page:  cn, wshifen \ com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.  Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their ""Big Data   platform"", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).  I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.  After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.  Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands? I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?  This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the ""nothing to hide"" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.  If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.   To Samsung, if you're reading this, please 1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them.","['know', 'title', 'sensational,', ""couldn't"", 'closer', 'truth.', ' ', 'busy', 'read', 'post,', ""here's"", 'tl;dr',

Android,"A notable amount of people already bought new phones just because they wanted to get to play Pokémon GO, so that's something.  But the thing is: that shit requires a good battery. My 3 year old S4 drains its self empty really quickly if I keep the game open while walking, and I know that's an issue with newer phones aswell. The big difference between Pokémon and other mobile games is that you'll play the game in places with no way to recharge your phone, and you often play for extended durations at once (instead of just log in, 2 min taptaptap, turn off).  Now in theory, if someone plays that game and is going to buy a new phone, it's more likely that they'll add ""need a really good battery"" on their list of ""features I want""... and as such, in the long run, phones with great batteries will sell more.  Which will, hopefully, lead to companies spending more time developing battery technologies since it's now a bigger selling point than before.

asktechnology,Hello! I am currently trying to create a massive mosaic and am struggling to find a program that works.  Every program I have found so far (andreamosaic and etc) is outdated and runs out of memory (works for smaller mosaics). The only other options I could find were online which costs money.  I have tried allocating more memory to the process as well as borrow my friend's computer which had 30GB of RAM and 8/12 cores without any luck.  I was wondering if you had any idea on either how to fix this issue or know a better program to use that does not cost money.

asktechnology,"Hello Reddit  Sorry if this isn't the best place for this post.  First time poster. Be easy.  The small start up I work for held a company-wide meeting today. Today was my day off so a Zoom link was sent to me.  I have to download the Zoom app to join the meeting, I do so and 'dial in'. I wasn't told I would be video conferencing so that's not what I expected.  The app asked permission for my mic. I allowed. I expected another prompt asking about video but no. So I join the meeting.  Now, the entire time I'm assuming I've only joined audio, I'm not on video.  I assume this because:   -I never gave the app permission  -I never saw myself on the screen  -There was a big red camera icon with a line through it at the bottom the screen 'START VIDEO'...meaning video was never enabled. Right? RIGHT?  I walked around my apartment in a very work-inappropriate top, went to the bathroom, walked into the next room and did other things while I only listened...  Worst of all though  Upon seeing a coworker who I've only met through text and emails, seeing how surprisingly handsome he was, I lost my shit. I silently blew kisses, kissed my phone screen, smushed the screen to my titties, etc.  Ya know, the kinds of things we do when we think no one is watching. Not thinking twice because I know I'm not on camera.  Now I'm thinking, 'could I have been on screen?' What if I actually did video conference in. WHAT IF IT WASN'T JUST AUDIO DEAR GOD  Zoom users.

asktechnology,"Hello everyone,  I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.  I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel in India, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.  Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.  Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.  Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""  So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.  Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

What we want to do is get a magazine article written on our product with a history of the project, how it currently runs, what the future possibilities will be, and some cool pictures go to along with it. Perhaps Popular Science or Popular Mechanics? I hear that sometimes they love stories/products like this for an article.  What do you guys suggest?

asktechnology,"Earlier this evening I saw some news about a popular MMORPG, and in the process of googling it, I clicked on a link to a popular gaming website (deliberately obfuscating them as I don't want to give them traffic).  The site I ended up at, despite being one of the internet's most popular gaming sites, was unusable. Half the screen was a banner ad. The site was jumping all over the place as ads appeared, before one of those interstitial popups appeared FOR THE SAME PRODUCT.  I guess I want to ask... How did things end up this way? This wasn't the case only \~5 years ago. Is it genuinely because the sites only care about views? (like if I open one of these sites, and it loads, and I IMMEDIATELY quit due to it being unusable, I am effectively a perfect customer for them?!)  Does everyone use adBlock? I've never bothered with it. I used to use a few similar tools back when genuine popups were a common thing (just to block them) but these days most browsers have that feature built in.

asktechnology,"Really, I want to know from those of you who know enough about Internet security confident enough to still engage in tertiary social media involvement.  I.E. If you're a hyper paranoid internet ""prepper""  you better tell me both sides of the coin before you say  Nuke it all.    &nbsp;   I'd call myself fairly moderate, tech savvy- ish, and sensible, but this is the benchmark I told myself I'd go cold.  I didn't feel comfortable with facebook and google, but this shit is putting my data in the hands of people I've never trusted to make a competent decision ever.  If I don't get a good enough how-to in the next week, then I'm seriously going to use every service available to scrub what I can of my past off the net, (if possible) delete every compromise-able account, app & operating system (ehem Window's X), purchase an air-gapped computer ( I imagine installing a usb-drive version of linux distro I arranged like a shady drug deal...I have no idea how to properly install that btw..or how to know I didn't get scammed), run my bank account dry and setup paper only everything, and setup dummy/allias accounts from burner computers and public wifi-spots and VPNs/proxies.  By then I'm sure I'll have learned how to properly use/navigate bitcoin or other cryptos albeit through trial and error.  I'd prefer not to trial and err though:  please someone tell me I can accomplish the same results for less effort...?? right??  &nbsp;  PS: (mildly disgruntled stoner tone) Fuck you if you think I'm over reacting.  Seriously, you didn't call your rep did you?; FUCK YOU  &nbsp;  EDIT 1 I a word  &nbsp;  EDIT 2.1 TAILS is an operating system on a storage medium that opens and operates directly from that medium & therefore not on the device in question.  I thought it did encryption or something and got sassy, my apologies. I will look more into this.   &nbsp;  Can anyone point me to a How-to guide to setup, operate, and navigate Tor browsers and network?  I only have a rudimentary knowledge of that, and not the slightest clue how to get on board confidently, & safely furthermore.   &nbsp;  PSAApparently,  more people are concerned about my heart rate.  Folks I was half asleep writing this, my tone was closer to that of a mildly defensive stoner than Tweek from Southpark.  &nbsp;   EDIT 3  Y'all for Gods sake (FP)  I'm not paranoid, I'm pragmatically pissed off for having something More to manage just to live reasonably secure in this country/era.  I have been trying to lurk-n-learn fundamental computer network tech for a few years now because I felt it was a great practical tool to understand, it sure as hell is always relevant.  Despite me being in a largely unrelated field.  I've been wanting to take the dive and learn IT security, network tech, and coding for a while.  What better time or project, than a complete reset of my digital foot print and standard operating procedure regarding the internet.?   &nbsp;  Either way, Y'all can't tell me that the UX for being an american citizen ain't a far cry from what you were assured was the bare minimum expectation for the millennium. Listen, I have certain expectations about what is reasonably public, private or public yet obscured/buried, regardless of whether it is ever used maliciously. It is simply me thinking long term; I get that it is very unlikely to be used in a way reminiscent of the current list of pop culture fear-fictif.  This is simply more like my intuition telling me to step the fuck back from the creepy business owner next door who doesn't appear to know a lot about his service-as-advertised, but is enthusiastically insistent he has something special for me in the back...Step back and then buy security cameras and new locks.  I'm doing this now so I don't have to go to extra or greater lengths later IF it ever gets too far.  I expect that if in 6 to 20 years the only things left on the web of me largely stop or water down after this year, I won't have nearly as much to manage if something unforeseen occurs.    &nbsp;  Guys, I'm not screaming here, just help me understand what I don't understand.  Or if you're going to keep fixating on this apparent caricature of my tone as discheveled, frantic and anxious, then point me somewhere that will give me the DETAILS I'm asking for:  What do I need to look out for as an first time tor-user (i.e. rookie mistakes), what is compatible, what isn't, are there scams out there I should be aware of, and if so how do I go about educating myself.  Don't forget; there is a FUCK TON of content about this on google alone, and most of it is peppered with half baked incomplete advice, and generally bad information.  Helping me sort through it all by sharing and discussing any nuance you are familiar with in a complete manner to a new comer would be... well.. golly that would just be swell ladies.     &nbsp;   PS I don't connect anything to facebook; phone, sign-ins, etc & barely use it because I don't like them, or want them monetizing my personal life.  So yea I already had a foot out the door.  I do a lot with google in comparison, but thats because they consistently provided fairly reasonable & user friendly privacy & personal data management features.  Early on, I figured Facebook and Google would be brought in line in terms of privacy.  There was a very SLOW bit of progress that gave me hope.  At least with those services I could switch, or find other options.  I don't know if you've been paying attention, but there aren't exaaactly a lot of competing options in any given local for me to rely on.    &nbsp;   EDIT W/E I mean come on guys, clearly I need a good point in the right direction.  I'm only now learning how to format blank line breaks...after 8 years on Reddit.

asktechnology,"My wife’s iPhone 11 pro was stolen right out of her hands, WHILE OPEN/UNLOCKED.   This one’s a doozy, with many unique factors coming into play starting with the first fact that the phone was stolen while in her hands  unlocked. Spoke with a number of Apple security reps and they’re stumped. So if you have the patience to read this story, please consider offering your advice.   Please read carefully. There are many factors to this situation that make it different than a normal stolen iPhone case.   First and foremost, we’re abroad in Vietnam. No data/cell service. Simply relying on free WiFi, and GPS tracking.   7:15 PM: My wife stops walking to check our location via GPS on google maps (she was not on WiFi) and I take a few more steps ahead (I’m full of guilt for not stopping as well to remain next to her, but I’m just a few steps ahead when...), a man on a motor scooter rides up on the sidewalk and snatches the phone from her hands and rides off. The phone was open/unlocked. She screams, I turn and start to chase him but he’s gone.   7:18ish PM: Immediately we get to WiFi and log in to her “find my iPhone” account on my phone (within 60-90 seconds at the nearest restaurant). But of course, without data service her iPhone 11 is “offline”. We set it to erase which says, “erase pending, your iPhone will be erased when it comes online”. I encourage us to walk down the block and just keep our eyes open for this guy in case he’s the stupid kind of thief that stopped right down the block. No dice.   7:33 PM: We return to WiFi in about 15 mins and check again her “find my iPhone” account. The device is still offline and erase is still pending. I realize that if we “erase” her phone we have no chance of tracking it when it goes online, so we “cancel erase” which prompts her for her password again, and we put it into lost mode. I also select, “notify me when online”. I also try to skype call Apple Support, but they’re closed. We get back to our hotel in another 30 mins, and check the app again. Still offline.   8:30 PM: We filed a claim with Asurion and another iPhone 11 Pro 256 GB is already on the way to my parents home in the states ($199 deductible in case anyone is wondering). We’re laying in bed, bummed about the phone, but more so the violation of having that situation happen. People suck sometimes, but we’re Ok I remind us and we go out for some dinner.   9:30 PM: We start having some other ideas, questions and proceed to discuss....the phone was unlocked when he stole it. What if he kept it open while riding away ? He can’t log into her Apple ID he would need two factor authentication for that (another one of her trusted devices that are all 6000 miles away at home) At first I thought no big deal, she doesn’t have Apple Pay setup and you still need the next level of passwords to access anything important / financial etc. and it should go locked as soon as he goes into WiFi to try anyway.   But we want assurances. So we call Apple support which is now open.   10:30 PM: the guy is mostly assuring us of what we thought. But to be totally certain we should change her Apple ID password. Like I said earlier you need you trusted devices to get your 6 digit, two factor authenticate code.  Ok here’s were things get even weirder.   Approx 11 PM: I want to check for her phone again to see if it ever came online and went into lost mode. THE DEVICE IS NO LONGER ON THE LIST OF DEVICES !! Only her old phone, air pods, and iPad. The iPhone 11 is gone ! Apple support who is still on the phone with us tells us the only way that can be done is via her Apple ID.   Our hearts sink. This guy got into her Apple ID ? How ??  Now we’re determined to change her password somehow.  So we’re calling her parents back at home to read us the code from her iPad so we can log in. We got it. We logged in and changed her password.   So fucking weird. But then another weird thing happens.   She’s logging into her gmail to change that password too, and we notice a “new login from an iPhone 6 at 9:32 PM one district north of our location. What the fuck ! How did this guy now get onto her gmail account, FROM HIS PHONE ! (I have an iPhone X).   He even deleted the email that emails you when a new login happens from a new device, went to the trash and deleted that forever so we wouldn’t see it right away. It was only because we were changing her password that we saw the new login event.   What a trip.   Now we’re up til 1 AM on the phone with another Apple rep and she’s genuinely invested and listening to my story, but stumped. How did the phone get deleted from the list of devices ? How did he login to her email on a different device ?  Any hackers out there know how to Do this shit ? I thought Apple had the best security.   Just one last note, my wife is European and all her passwords were pretty complex and in her language (Slovak). A pretty strange language whether you’re a Vietnamese and/or English speaker. He didn’t trial and error guess her passwords within two hours of getting her phone. They are too difficult and random.","['wife’s', 'iphone', '11', 'pro', 'stolen', 'right', 'hands,', 'open/unlocked.', '  ', 'one’s', 'doozy,', 'unique', 'factors', 'coming', 'play', 'starting', 'fact', 'phone', 'stolen', 'hands', ' ', 'unlocked.', 'spoke', 'number', 'apple', 'security', 'reps', 'they’re', 'stumped.', 'patience', 'read', 'story,', 'consider', 'offering', 'advice.', '  ', 'read', 'carefully.', 'factors', 'situation', 'different', 'normal', 'stolen', 'iphone', 'case.', '  ', 'foremost,', 'we’re', 'abroad', 'vietnam.', 'data/cell', 'service.', 'simply', 'relying', 'free', 'wifi,', 'gps', 'tracking.', '  ', '7:15', 'pm:', 'wife', 'stops', 'walking', 'check', 'location', 'gps', 'google', 'maps', '(she', 'wifi)', 'steps', 'ahead', '(i’m', 'guilt', 'stopping', 'remain', 'her,', 'i’m', 'steps', 'ahead', 'when...),', 'man', 'motor', 'scooter', 'rides', 'sidewalk', 'snatches', 'phone', 'hands', 'rides', 'off.', 'phone', 'open/unlocked.', 'screams,', 'turn', 'start', 'chase', 'he’s', 'gone.', '  ', '7:18ish', 'pm:', 'immediately', 'wifi', 'log', '“find', 'iphone”', 'account', 'phone', '(within', '60-90', 'seconds', 'nearest', 'restaurant).', 'course,', 'data', 'service', 'iphone', '11', '“offline”.', 'set', 'erase', 'says,', '“erase', 'pending,', 'iphone', 'erased', 'comes', 'online”.', 'encourage', 'walk', 'block', 'eyes', 'open', 'guy', 'case', 'he’s', 'stupid', 'kind', 'thief', 'stopped', 'right', 'block.', 'dice.', '  ', '7:33', 'pm:', 'return', 'wifi', '15', 'mins', 'check', '“find', 'iphone”', 'account.', 'device', 'offline', 'erase', 'pending.', 'realize', '“erase”', 'phone', 'chance', 'tracking', 'goes', 'online,', '“cancel', 'erase”', 'prompts', 'password', 'again,', 'lost', 'mode.', 'select,', '“notify', 'online”.', 'try', 'skype', 'apple', 'support,', 'they’re', 'closed.', 'hotel', '30', 'mins,', 'check', 'app', 'again.', 'offline.', '  ', '8:30', 'pm:', 'filed', 'claim', 'asurion', 'iphone', '11', 'pro', '256', 'gb', 'way', 'parents', 'home', 'states', '($199', 'deductible', 'case', 'wondering).', 'we’re', 'laying', 'bed,', 'bummed', 'phone,', 'violation', 'having', 'situation', 'happen.', 'people', 'suck', 'sometimes,', 'we’re', 'ok', 'remind', 'dinner.', '  ', '9:30', 'pm:', 'start', 'having', 'ideas,', 'questions', 'proceed', 'discuss....the', 'phone', 'unlocked', 'stole', 'it.', 'kept', 'open', 'riding', 'away', 'can’t', 'log', 'apple', 'id', 'need', 'factor', 'authentication', '(another', 'trusted', 'devices', '6000', 'miles', 'away', 'home)', 'thought', 'big', 'deal,', 'doesn’t', 'apple', 'pay', 'setup', 'need', 'level', 'passwords', 'access', 'important', 'financial', 'etc.', 'locked', 'soon', 'goes', 'wifi', 'try', 'anyway.', '  ', 'want', 'assurances.', 'apple', 'support', 'open.', '  ', '10:30', 'pm:', 'guy', 'assuring', 'thought.', 'totally', 'certain', 'change', 'apple', 'id', 'password.', 'like', 'said', 'earlier', 'need', 'trusted', 'devices', '6', 'digit,', 'factor', 'authenticate', 'code.', ' ', 'ok', 'here’s', 'things', 'weirder.', '  ', 'approx', '11', 'pm:', 'want', 'check', 'phone', 'came', 'online', 'went', 'lost', 'mode.', 'device', 'longer', 'list', 'devices', 'old', 'phone,', 'air', 'pods,', 'ipad.', 'iphone', '11', 'gone', 'apple', 'support', 'phone', 'tells', 'way', 'apple', 'id.', '  ', 'hearts', 'sink.', 'guy', 'got', 'apple', 'id', ' ', 'we’re', 'determined', 'change', 'password', 'somehow.', ' ', 'we’re', 'calling', 'parents', 'home', 'read', 'code', 'ipad', 'log', 'in.', 'got', 'it.', 'logged', 'changed', 'password.', '  ', 'fucking', 'weird.', 'weird', 'thing', 'happens.', '  ', 'she’s', 'logging', 'gmail', 'change', 'password', 'too,', 'notice', '“new', 'login', 'iphone', '6', '9:32', 'pm', 'district', 'north', 'location.', 'fuck', 'guy', 'gmail', 'account,', 'phone', '(i', 'iphone', 'x).', '  ', 'deleted', 'email', 'emails', 'new', 'login', 'happens', 'new', 'device,', 'went', 'trash', 'deleted', 'forever', 'wouldn’t', 'right', 'away.', 'changing', 'password', 'saw', 'new', 'login', 'event.', '  ', 'trip.', '  ', 'we’re', 'til', '1', 'phone', 'apple', 'rep', 'she’s', 'genuinely', 'invested', 'listening', 'story,', 'stumped.', 'phone', 'deleted', 'list', 'devices', 'login', 'email', 'different', 'device', ' ', 'hackers', 'know', 'shit', 'thought', 'apple', 'best', 'security.', '  ', 'note,', 'wife', 'european', 'passwords', 'pretty', 'complex', 'language', '(slovak).', 'pretty', 'strange', 'language', 'you’re', 'vietnamese', 'and/or', 'english', 'speaker.', 'didn’t', 'trial', 'error', 'guess', 'passwords', 'hours', 'getting', 'phone.', 'difficult', 'random.']"

When I was 17, my boyfriend took a semi-nude picture of me at my request and emailed it to me. I was posed on the couch, in a lacy bra and panties. I briefly saved it in a very hidden file on the family computer, then eventually thought better of that plan and deleted it.  Several months later, I was at my parents' home (I had moved out by then) using the computer and saw that my father had left his email account open. I'm not proud of this, but I snooped. What I found was extremely disturbing. There were two emails sent months prior with that picture attached in his outbox. There was no text, so I googled the email addresses he had sent this picture to. They were both small internet porn companies. There were no further emails to or from those addresses.  I didn't say anything about it at the time. I was too busy just trying to survive. I confronted him about it several years later. He claimed that he had never seen that picture before, that he didn't send it to anyone, and that his email account must have been hacked.  I've posed this question to a couple of tech-knowledgeable friends, and they've said that it's theoretically possible but pretty unbelievable that this could have been accomplished by hacking. It's really hard to believe that my father did this, so here I am, asking Reddit for additional opinions. Somebody please tell me there's an explanation for why/how a hacker would find the one mildly sexy picture saved to the computer and email it to two porn companies from my father's account without any text? Alternately, if it's the hard truth, tell me that my father's an absolute creep and there's no other reasonable explanation.","['sorry', 'downer', 'subreddit', ""that's"", 'probably', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'time.', ""i'm"", 'hoping', 'folks', 'knowledgeable', 'hacking', 'weigh', 'here.', ' ', '17,', 'boyfriend', 'took', 'semi-nude', 'picture', 'request', 'emailed', 'me.', 'posed', 'couch,', 'lacy', 'bra', 'panties.', 'briefly', 'saved', 'hidden', 'file', 'family', 'computer,', 'eventually', 'thought', 'better', 'plan', 'deleted', 'it.', ' ', 'months', 'later,', ""parents'"", 'home', '(i', 'moved', 'then)', 'computer', 'saw', 'father', 'left', 'email', 'account', 'open.', ""i'm"", 'proud', 'this,', 'snooped.', 'found', 'extremely', 'disturbing.', 'emails', 'sent', 'months', 'prior', 'picture', 'attached', 'outbox.', 'text,', 'googled', 'email', 'addresses', 'sent', 'picture', 'to.', 'small', 'internet', 'porn', 'companies.', 'emails', 'addresses.', ' ', ""didn't"", 'time.', 'busy', 'trying', 'survive.', 'confronted', 'years', 'later.', 'claimed', 'seen', 'picture', 'before,', ""didn't"", 'send', 'anyone,', 'email', 'account', 'hacked.', ' ', ""i've"", 'posed', 'question', 'couple', 'tech-knowledgeable', 'friends,', ""they've"", 'said', ""it's"", 'theoretically', 'possible', 'pretty', 'unbelievable', 'accomplished', 'hacking.', ""it's"", 'hard', 'believe', 'father', 'this,', 'am,', 'asking', 'reddit', 'additional', 'opinions.', 'somebody', 'tell', ""there's"", 'explanation', 'why/how', 'hacker', 'find', 'mildly', 'sexy', 'picture', 'saved', 'computer', 'email', 'porn', 'companies', ""father's"", 'account', 'text?', 'alternately,', ""it's"", 'hard', 'truth,', 'tell', ""father's"", 'absolute', 'creep', ""there's"", 'reasonable', 'explanation.']"
buildapc,"Last Saturday I posted about building a gaming computer for my son for pretty much just Minecraft.  I had $300 to work with.  I expected a few replies and a few pointers.  The response to that post was unbelievable.  I woke up the next day and my wife told me she needed to silence my phone in the middle of the night.  Over 40K views and over 300 replies.  I now know the meaning of RIP inbox.  I got a lot of great advice from a lot of people.  In the end, it was pretty clear.  I could build it for $300, but it wouldn't be great.  It may play Minecraft, but that's about it.  I would be better off spending more money on a build, and well, my wife and I didnt really have more money to put towards it.   Let me start by saying I was messaged by quite a few of you about graphics card, mother boards, processors that they had laying around. Willing to send them to me for nothing, or maybe some shipping.  The generosity of this sub is amazing.  I was never looking for anything but advice, and many of you offered many things.  For that I am very grateful.   Then I was messaged by a member of this sub who wishes to remain anonymous.  They offered to purchase a WHOLE BUILD for me.  They said they were around my son's age when they got into building computers and technology.  They now work with computers as their profession and wish they could have shared a similar experience with their dad growing up.   I was skeptical to say the least, but they were very genuine in their message and honestly I don't know how I could have said no.  Over the next few days we sent messages back and forth and he put together a build for my son and I.  My wife kept telling me its crazy and someone was messing with me.  I stayed a little skeptical but I could tell through the conversations we had that this person was truly a good person looking to make a positive impact.  As of last night, all the parts were ordered and are being shipped straight to my house.  They have sent me order confirmations as well as tracking on all the parts for the build from Amazon and Newegg.  Here is the build: ( / (  Type|Item|Price :----|:----|:---- CPU | ( | $279.99 @ B&H  CPU Cooler | ( | $59.90 @ Amazon  Motherboard | ( | $56.98 @ Newegg  Memory | ( | $204.99 @ Newegg  Storage | ( | $97.99 @ B&H  Video Card | ( | $514.98 @ Newegg  Case | ( | $54.99 @ SuperBiiz  Power Supply | ( | $83.99 @ SuperBiiz   | Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts |  | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $1363.81  | Mail-in rebates | -$10.00  | Total | $1353.81  | Generated by ( 2017-12-06 18:00 EST-0500 |   All I can say is that it is truly a Christmas miracle.   I have never been so moved by the generosity of one person before.  I am in shock and words cannot describe the excitement I have to build this amazing computer with my son.   I do not think I will ever be able to thank this person enough for what they have done.  All they asked in return is to pay it forward.  And believe me I will!  I will be sure to update when the build is completed!    Merry Christmas everyone!    TLDR: Wanted to build with my son.  Didn't have a budget that was good.  A stranger on the internet sent me $1300+ of parts to build with my son.  I still am in shock.  Edit:Spelling  Edit2: Wow. Thank you for the gold.  This community is gold.

I contacted Newegg.com and was transferred to a supervisor.  They refused to replace the keys with verifiably genuine Microsoft products and refused a refund.  They did offer to email me more pirated keys(they called them digital but could offer no evidence they were anything other than what Microsoft said). They refused to acknowledge that Microsoft confirmed Newegg.com’s keys were pirated, constantly trying to say things like, “I’m sorry you weren’t able to get your keys to work” or, “I can assure you that all of our keys are genuine, but they don’t always work.”   Fact check;  Microsoft has already confirmed these were pirated keys.  As for them not always working?  49% of Newegg’s reviews for this item are 1 Star...nearly all of them saying the same thing...the keys don’t work and Microsoft says they are no good.

buildapc,"#Guide to Setting up Windows 10 & Maintaining your PC ^^Updated ^^4/22/2020  This is assuming you have successfully completed your PC build and are wondering what to do next. Here’s a few helpful tips I have learned over the years.   Warning: Yee who don't like opinions, probably don't dare enter..  &nbsp;  Windows Installation:  Download ( Create a USB installation drive using the tool and boot to the drive by changing boot order in your motherboard UEIF/BIOS.  Start the install, choose “Customize Settings” and turn everything on this screen off. Proceed to install Windows with a local account. If you're okay with Microsoft collecting some data, you can always sync your Windows account later in Settings > Accounts. The benefit being Windows will backup your settings and can sync them with other PCs you own.   Once you boot up, head over to Settings > Update and Security. Check for updates and go grab your favorite beverage and let it complete, you may reboot multiple times during this step.  Once you're done updating, go to Start > Settings > Privacy and go down ( and turn everything off unless you actually use it.    Same goes for background apps -- only disable apps from running in the background that you don't want notifications from. It's safe to disable background apps completely if you don't care.   Under ""Feedback & Diagnostics"" switch that to ""Basic"". Once that is done, head to Settings > Update and Security > Advanced Options > Delivery Optimization and turn it off. That setting allows P2P updates across your network which is a potential security risk.   Next head over to Settings > Network and Internet > Wi-Fi and turn everything off here besides the Wi-Fi itself.   Having done all of that correctly, you have disabled the bulk of data logging, background app usage and diagnostic feedback. Yay! Windows is installed. Much of what you do next is personal preference (appearance, software, customization) but there are a few things I would like to recommend.  &nbsp;    Quick accessibility tip - Open Control Panel and at the top-right change ""View by:"" to ""Small icons"". It will make more sense following this guide.     &nbsp;  Update motherboard BIOS - If everything is working properly, and you are happy with the performance of your PC - It is generally not recommended to update the BIOS as there is always the potential for something to go wrong. That being said, if you follow the installation instructions exactly from your MOBO manufacturer, you will be fine.    For all BIOS and firmware updates, I will refer you to your manufacturer’s support page to ensure you are getting the latest and greatest. Follow the instructions there for how to install (typically downloading the update to a FAT 32 USB drive and flashing the update in your UEIF/BIOS).   &nbsp;  Drivers: Windows 10 will automatically update and install drivers for your hardware via Windows Update. This is typically fine for everything except your GPU and chipset, which we will take care of next.   &nbsp;  Update your graphics card driver – Again, head over to your manufacturer’s website and follow the instructions there to install:  AMD - ( (also in the Additional Tools section below) to check the internal temperatures of your CPU, GPU, etc.. to make sure nothing looks out of the ordinary. If anything appears abnormal you can try reapplying the thermal paste to make sure you have adequate coverage.   As far as where temperatures should be. That will differ drastically depending on your cooling solution (air, water, AIO, passive), ambient temperatures, overall case airflow and cooling performance of individual hardware. Generally if you are idling and your CPU/GPU is near or under 45°-50° you are likely doing just fine.   &nbsp;  You can also test your ram by using Windows Memory Diagnostic. Just type Windows Memory Diagnostic in to Windows search and it will come up. You will be required to restart your PC to test. When you are done, head to Event Viewer > Windows Logs > System and the results should be the most recent log (at the top). If it's not, filter for Event ID 1201.   &nbsp;  Change refresh rate on monitor - If you have a 144hz or 120hz monitor, and either a DisplayPort, HDMI 2.0, or DVI-D (Dual-Link) connection, it’s a good time to look at your refresh rates. If you own an Nvidia card, change it in Nvidia control panel. For an AMD card, follow these steps:   Right-click your desktop and choose Display settings  Scroll down and select Display adapter properties  In the properties window click on List All Modes  Scroll down and choose your desired mode (e.g. 144hz) and apply  Note: If you have more than one monitor you will need to select the other monitor in windows display and repeat steps above.   &nbsp;    Edit: Ehh.. Thinking back I would just ignore this part. The firmware your drives ship with are just fine. It's not worth it, just leave it alone.   ~~Update your SSD firmware - This may be a new concept to those coming from an HDD but your SSD’s firmware can be updated as well. To begin, head over to your manufacturer’s support page (yes again) and to ensure things go smoothly, I recommend downloading their management software. If you just purchased your SSD, you will more than likely find it is already updated. They are not frequent so if you're not concerned, feel free to skip this step.~~  ~~• Crucial offers their “Storage Executive Management software”, and Samsung has “Samsung Magician”. If you own a different SSD search its support page and see what they offer.~~  ~~• Crucial offers a “Momentum Cache” feature which speeds up your drive at the expense of using RAM and the potential for data loss. I go into more depth on it (  Personally, I’d leave it disabled if you’re happy with its performance and your workload doesn't demand it. For normal gaming and office use you won't notice a difference. Samsung offers a similar feature called ""Rapid"" and while I have not used it personally, I would say my opinion on it stands.~~  ~~Warning: Some manufacturers may format when upgrading. Please READ the instructions carefully. I am not responsible for any data loss.~~   (  (  &nbsp;    Anti-virus/malware:   This can be a polarizing subject for some, and I can only offer my experience, but after years of searching and experimenting this is what works for me. I will also preface this by saying, depending on your browsing/download habits this can change entirely. Ultimately, my best advice on the subject is:   #Do your research and find what works best for you.   That being said, I use the following and it's all available for free…    Anti-Virus: Windows Defender – For me, Windows Defender is good enough. It’s simple, and FREE. Stay vigilant and let it run on its schedule scans and build its definitions, scan periodically if you wish.  Anti-Malware: Malwarebytes Free/uBlock Origin – Again, the free version of Malwarebytes is good enough for me. While browsing, uBlock will do the bulk of your malware blocking and if you suspect anything got by, run a Malwarebytes scan. I run Malwarebytes every couple of weeks personally for peace of mind.  Firewall: Windows Firewall. While behind a router there isn't much use for a soft Firewall, it is good for protecting yourself within your own network. E.g. if another PC on your network gets infected, it could prevent your device from contracting the virus/malware. It is also useful to create outbound rules for preventing certain applications from accessing the internet if you don't want them too.   &nbsp;  Additional Plug-ins for safer browsing:   ( - Privacy Badger stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web.   ( - HTTPS everywhere rewrites all web requests to use HTTPS wherever possible.    ( - NoScript is an open source add-on that allows JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins to be executed only by trusted web sites of your choice (e.g. your online bank).  &nbsp;  Additional configuration:  Malwarebytes:   Go into the settings and enable “Scan for rootkits”.  uBlock Origin:   The default settings will block 99% of ads and malware, but if you want more protection/AD blocking/annoyances filtering, head over to uBlock settings > 3rd party filters. I enabled all uBlock filters (except Experimental), all “Ads” filters (except mobile), all “Privacy” filters, all “Malware Domains” filters and all “Annoyances” filters.   I’ve never had any issues browsing or viewing content while using these settings, but to each their own.  If you have issues you can always reset to default on the settings home page. There is said to be a drop in performance if you are doubling up on items in your lists, but if there is it's negligible and I haven't noticed any. Other than that, the worse that can happen is that you increase the chance of rendering a page incorrectly. Not a bad trade off for peace of mind while browsing.  &nbsp;    Performance Monitor:  Windows should be mostly configured at this point. I'd recommend running this report to see if Windows detects any issues or has any suggestions about your current setup. If you receive passing grades on everything, pat yourself on the back. If you received a fail or warning, don't panic, just read the suggestion and follow the instructions on how to resolve it:  1. Open a 'RUN window' by pressing the 'Windows key + R' 2. Type perfmon /report and hit Run 3. Wait and check your results  &nbsp;  I like to routinely check Reliability Monitor just to see how my system is doing day to day. It will report any critical errors or update failures so you can, well... see how ""reliable"" your system is. If you go 5 days without any critical errors reported than congratulations you have a very healthy system. Also, keep in mind the extent of the error reported. If Malwarebytes crashing shows up as a critical error or crash, I don't think that's a good representation of your system health. Some stuff is unavoidable, Windows isn't near perfect.   Along with Reliability Monitor, keep an eye on Event Viewer to track any errors you may come across. It should be your first step in troubleshooting issues. Ignore any ""DistributedCOM"" errors. They've been around since Windows 8 and everyone gets them, they're harmless.   &nbsp;  CPU Overclocking:  There is a huge community behind overclocking, and while it can be fun to eek out extra scores in benchmarks, it honestly isn't worth the hassle of the average PC user. On modern Ryzen and Intel chips, algorithms have been built into account for this and will automatically clock frequencies up and down depending on thermal performance. If you bought a CPU in 2018 or later, my opinion would be to just let it do it's thing.   &nbsp;  XMP Profile / Overclocking RAM  Enable your XMP profile in BIOS so your RAM can run at its rated speed. There are too many different boards and ways to do this, so just type your ""motherboard name + XMP Profile"" into Google to see how to do it.    Maintenance/Upkeep:   Windows Disk Cleanup. Nothing against CCleaner, but it's unnecessary and deletes valuable Windows Defender files. Also, it comes with a registry cleaner which shouldn't be used for any reason.   Realistically, if you're not pressed on hard drive space or experiencing issues, there is no reason to run a cleaner of any kind. If you run Windows Disk Cleanup just understand what you are cleaning before you check mark it for deletion.   &nbsp;  Registry:  Your registry is essentially a Windows database that informs your operating system and applications how to behave and appear. That being said,  Don't use registry cleaners. While CCleaner is harmless when used correctly, messing with your registry always creates the potential for harm. You will never see any measurable performance increase from using a registry cleaner.  If you know what you are doing, the registry is a fantastic tool for making UI or OS changes (e.g. removing the ""3D objects folder from File Explorer, removing OneDrive, etc...). As always, just make a backup first.  &nbsp;  Defragging your HDD - Probably don't need to do this often, once every month or so, or after very large frequent file writes. FYI, Windows automatically sets a schedule to defrag your HDD every week by default.  To change the schedule or run it manually, go into ""My PC"" > Right-click your HDD > Properties > Tools > Defragment. Analyze the drive and if it's over 10-15% fragmented, considered running the defrag.  Do NOT use third party tools to defrag your SSD.  Note: The native Windows 10 defragger is smart enough to know this, it won't give you the option if you try. Instead, what you will find is that Windows does a version of defragging once a month by default called 'Optimizing'. You can read a really good article about it ( In short, don't worry and let Windows do its thing.   &nbsp;  Backup:   I use Windows Backup and Restore. I'm sure there are more comprehensive tools out there, some 3rd party ones which were suggested below, but there really isn't anything more comprehensive than creating a system image. You can do this by navigating to Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > Backup and Restore (Windows 7). Once I have set up Windows to my liking I create a system image and store it on an external drive or a secondary HDD, preferably both. Do it periodically if you have the space. You will thank yourself if you ever run into an issue and need to restore from an image.   You can also use the Full or Incremental backup feature, but I prefer just to have a system image on hand in case of a failure. Backup all of your important files and documents to the cloud so they are safe from system coruption and accessible across your devices. Google Drive is a great tool.    A system image is an exact copy, or clone, of your drive in that particular state when you created it. You can use it to restore the system after a catastrophic crash, hard disk failure, etc...   A Full Backup contains data files, but not everything on the disk. You cannot use it to restore the system.  &nbsp;  System Restore:   Go to Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > System > System Protection. Chose your C: drive and click ""Configure..."". Turn on system protection and choose a percentage of space you have to spare. 5% is typically more than enough. Use this option if you ever have an issue and need to restore to a particular point in time - before a faulty Windows update for instance.   &nbsp;  UPS:   If you can afford to buy one, buy one. For those who don't know what they are, UPS stands for Uninterruptible Power Supply. I own two APC models I got from Amazon and living in Florida, they've saved my ass during many o' thunderstorms, power outages, brownouts and surges. Keeping a steady flow of electricity to my PC, it's good peace of mind to have.   If you are wondering, it is okay to plug a UPS into a quality surge protector like the Tripp Lite Isobar 2, home UPS devices typically don't have high joule ratings (surge protection).   &nbsp;  Physical Maintenance:   I'm sure everyone has their own routine for this step, and depending on where your PC is located it may require more frequent cleaning/dusting. Always keep pressurized air (duster) handy. Once every few months or whenever you notice a dust build-up, open it up and blast it. Hold your fans in place so you are not spinning the blades, this can generate an electrical current and potentially damage your circuit headers. I would avoid using any sort of vacuum attachments as there is a good risk of damaging your components. For tempered glass, use a microfiber cloth to buff out any smudges. Glass cleaners are safe to use on tempered glass, but I would still dilute them so your mixture is half-water, half-cleaner. Other than that, find a nice cool place with good airflow to keep your machine running smoothly.   &nbsp;     Extras (optional steps):  Calibrate monitors – Windows has a color calibration tool built-in. Or if you’re lucky enough you will find a guide for your specific monitor. Just do a Google search for “Calibrate + Your monitor model” and see what kind of information is out there. Tom’s Hardware had a good one for my AOC and I have noticed more defined colors since doing it.    Enable High Performance power plan - Go to Control Panel > Power Options and choose the ""High Performance"" plan.   Disable “Enhance pointer precision” – Go to Control Panel > Mouse > Pointer options and uncheck “Enhance pointer precision”. This will give you more control over your mouse while gaming. You can read more on it (   ( – I don’t know who uses Cortana, but it annoys the hell out of me.   ( - Only if you don't use it, I prefer Google Drive.   ( - If you have an SSD, disable this. It will not affect restarting your PC, but when doing a shutdown it will not reinitialize drivers meaning any driver related issue you were having before your shutdown, will persist when booting up the next time. u/agent268 has a very informative ( on it.   Disable Remote Connections  - Go to Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > System > Remote settings and uncheck ""Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer"". Below that select ""Don't allow remote connections to this computer"" if you are not remoting in to it.    Turn on Dark mode - Right-click your Desktop and select ""Personalize"". Select ""Colors"" on the left, scroll to the bottom and select dark. (   &nbsp;    Additional tools of the trade:   ( - Check drive status and health   ( - Hardware monitoring program that reports basically ever sensor your PC has to offer: voltages, temperatures, fans speed, etc...   ( - Display information on Processor name and number, codename, process, package, cache levels. Mainboard and chipset. Memory type, size, timings, and module specifications (SPD). Real time measurement of each core's internal frequency, memory frequency.   ( - Use to completely uninstall an application along with leftover files and registry keys. This gives you even less reason to mess with your registry.   ( - Allows you to easily batch install many common and essential programs in one step. (u/mrdirkles)   ( - Disk usage statistics viewer and cleanup tool. If you don't know where all of your drive space is going, this tool will help you find out. (u/DelXL)   ( - An alternative to the native Windows defragment tool. Brought to you by the same folks that brought you CCleaner. (u/brightboy)   Use Acronis, Macrium or Easeus to backup your OS drive. This way you can revert to any point in time (like after a clean install and configuration) without the hassle of reinstalling updates/drivers. (u/wittywalrus1)  I have used Macrium Free personally to clone an SSD and it went very well, I have not tried the others. As always, do your research.  &nbsp;  I'm not going to include information on going buck wild disabling services and data logging because what I mentioned above is sufficient for me, but if you feel inclined you can search yourself and find some good posts on the subject. I don't recommend using the SpyBot tools because they modify system values and if you're going to do that, you should learn what you're doing and modify it yourself in case something goes wrong. In a recent Windows update they provided the ability to delete your stored diagnostic data in Settings > Privacy > Diagnostics & feedback > Scroll down to ""Delete diagnostic data"", just take it with a grain of salt as to what actually gets deleted. If you've stuck around this long, I love you.","['#guide', 'setting', 'windows', '10', 'maintaining', 'pc', '^^updated', '^^4/22/2020', ' ', 'assuming', 'successfully', 'completed', 'pc', 'build',

buildapc,"My son wants a EVGA GEFORCE GTX 1050ti SC..     Its $216.  We have 4 kids and I can’t afford that for one gift for one kid.  He plays COD, Overwatch etc etc on it so he’s a gamer, I just am not sure what I can get that’s comparable or somewhat close for less than this.    Currently he’s using a vid card that 4+ years old, so anything at this point would probably be an upgrade.    Thanks so much guys for your help   ----------------------- EDIT:   All I can say is WOW.  I certainly didn't come here expecting this, I was only looking for advice for alternatives.  Just... wow.   I figured it would be fitting to do a quick edit to let you all know what the plan is with the video card droxgh04 is so thoughtfully sending to my son (partially taken from one of my earlier replies on this thread).  My son is going to see this thread, and I couldn't be happier. Im going to give him the video card that droxgh04 is giving him, the tag will say FROM ""droxgh04"" and not me, which will be confusing to him but amazing to see. I'm also including a complete print out of this entire thread (sans neg comments and the dildo discussion above which was completely fascinating, but not appropriate for his dad to include for him).  I'll take pictures when he opens the gift, reads the thread and post it all here after Christmas day.  Thanks to droxgh04 and all of you here, my son is going to learn an incredible lesson far more valuable than getting just a video card from his dad on Christmas. Now, he's getting a gift from a complete stranger who turned a simple question into an inspiring moment which has seemed to impact a couple thousand people.   So thanks to you droxgh04, Branden isn't just getting a video card from you for christmas, but he's getting a lesson of giving, and along with a box full of humanity.  Thank you all so much.   I'll DEFINITELY be paying it forward, and I hope all of you do the same as well.

buildapc,"UserBenchmark just got banned on r/hardware and should also be banned here. Not everyone is aware of how biased their ""benchmarks"" are and how misleading their scoring is. This can influence the decisions of novice pc builders negatively and should be mentioned here.   Among the shady shit they're pulling: something along the lines of the i3 being superior to the 3900x because multithreaded performance is irrelevant.  Another new comparison where an i5-10600 gets a higher overall score than a 3600 despite being worse on every single test:   Oh and their response to criticism of their methods was nothing more than insults to the reddit community and playing this off as a smear campaign:   Even if this post doesn't get traction or if the mods disagree and it doesn't get banned, please just refrain from using that website and never consider it a reliable source.  Edit: First, a response to some criticism in the comments:  You are right, even if their methodology is dishonest, userbenchmark is still very useful when comparing your PC's performance with the same components to check for problems.  Nevertheless, they are tailoring the scoring methods to reduce multi-thread weights while giving an advantage to single-core performance. Multi-thread computing will be the standard in the near future and software and game developers are already starting to adapt to that. Game developers are still trailing behind but they will have to do it if they intend to use the full potential of next-gen consoles, and they will. userbenchmark should emphasize more on Multi-thread performance and not do the opposite. As u/FrostByte62 put it: ""Userbenchmark is a fantic tool to quickly identify your hardware and quickly test if it's performing as expected based on other users findings. It should not be used for determining which hardware is better to buy, though. Tl;Dr: know when to use Userbenchmark. Only for apples to apples comparisons. Not apples to oranges. Or maybe a better metaphor is only fuji apples to fuji apples. Not fuji apples to granny smith apples.""  As shitty and unprofessional their actions and their response to criticism were, a ban is probably not the right decision and would be too much hassle for the mods. I find the following suggestion by u/TheCrimsonDagger to be a better solution: whenever someone posts a link to userbenchmark (or another similarly biased website), automod would post a comment explaining that userbenchmark is known to have biased testing methodology and shouldn’t be used as a reliable source by itself.    ---- here is a list of alternatives that were mentioned in the comments: Hardware Unboxed  Anandtech  PC-Kombo   Techspot  and my personal favorite pcpartpicker.com - it lets you build your own PC from a catalog of practically every piece of hardware on the market, from CPUs and Fans to Monitors and keyboards. The prices are updated regulary from known sellers like amazon and newegg. There are user reviews for common parts. There are comptability checks for CPU sockets, GPU, radiator and case sizes, PSU capacity and system wattage, etc. It is not garanteed that these sources are 100% unbiased, but they do have a good reputation for content quality.

buildapc,"No one will probably see this but whatever. Need to say something because it genuinely makes me feel bad. I frequent this sub and it's the first place I come to when I have a specific question about my PC or build. Unfortunately, I've posted many times with questions I couldn't find the answer to or would take too long for me to confirm on my own and almost always received no responses.   It seems to me from my time here that posts with funny content, or posts that show someone's dumb ""mistake"" make it to the front page easily and are met with tons of conversation and discussion. But when I check out the ""new"" section, it's filled with legitimate questions that I feel would be very easy for knowledgeable people to answer, yet they're all empty and downvoted.   I'm not angry that I have been trying all day to get some feedback on my PC upgrades, but only a couple of people have given me a minute of their time. But I do feel kind of sad especially for the younger folks on here trying to get some help with their first or second builds or have a burning question. I'm also not saying people aren't doing enough on this subreddit I just feel this subreddit was meant to be a place where beginners could get help from more experience people and it certainly does not that feel that way.   Maybe I'm in the minority or maybe I'm the only one feeling this way but I really like this subreddit, and it's unfortunate I have to go to subreddits like pcmr to ask questions about my build.   Anyway, please downvote if I'm spouting nonsense which I very well may be. Thanks for reading.  Edit: I appreciate people helping me out now, and I'm sorry if I sounded a bit angry in my post it's been a long day. I still do stand by it though, and would love your opinions if you have any!  I understand it's impossible to help everyone and there's far more questions than people able to answer them. This is my personal experience as I have been browsing this subreddit for more than a year and feel this way currently. But I've read your responses and I appreciate you letting me see the other side of this.   As someone reminded me, the daily questions thread is another place to post as well.   Last Edit: I'm going to bed now I really can't believe the response to this post and I'm very glad it stirred some genuine discussion about the topic. I think it's best to not look at it from a sides point of view and we should all just try to be patient and help each other out as much as possible. Thanks to a lot of you today I learned a lot and will pay that forward.   E3: okay I just woke up and this is absolutely insane. So first off a lot of people are calling me elitist or cunt and I appreciate your contribution to the discussion. Here is the thing. I've found from experience it has been easier to get support or advice when posting about a build on OTHER subs  than this one. Whether thats pcmr or a smaller sub, it justs frustrated me that a subreddit dedicated to helping with builds had a severe lack of exactly that. I'm not blaming anyone and its okay if you think I'm being elitist but thats how I viewed this sub. And obviously my views have shifted thanks to all the discussion going on here, so again thanks for participating.","['probably', 'whatever.', 'need', 'genuinely', 'makes', 'feel', 'bad.', 'frequent', 'sub', ""it's"", 'place', 'come', 'specific', 'question', 'pc', 'build.', 'unfortunately,', ""i've"", 'posted', 'times', 'questions', ""couldn't"", 'find', 'answer', 'long', 'confirm', 'received', 'responses.', '  ', 'time', 'posts', 'funny', 'content,', 'posts', ""someone's"", 'dumb', '""mistake""', 'page', 'easily', 'met', 'tons', 'conversation', 'discussion.', 'check', '""new""', 'section,', ""it's"", 'filled', 'legitimate', 'questions', 'feel', 'easy', 'knowledgeable', 'people', 'answer,', ""they're"", 'downvoted.', '  ', ""i'm"", 'angry', 'trying', 'day', 'feedback', 'pc', 'upgrades,', 'couple', 'people', 'given', 'minute', 'time.', 'feel', 'kind', 'sad', 'especially', 'younger', 'folks', 'trying', 'help', 'second', 'builds', 'burning', 'question.', ""i'm"", 'saying', 'people', ""aren't"", 'subreddit', 'feel', 'subreddit', 'meant', 'place', 'beginners', 'help', 'experience', 'people', 'certainly', 'feel', 'way.', '  ', 'maybe', ""i'm"", 'minority', 'maybe', ""i'm"", 'feeling', 'way', 'like', 'subreddit,', ""it's"", 'unfortunate', 'subreddits', 'like', 'pcmr', 'ask', 'questions', 'build.', '  ', 'anyway,', 'downvote', ""i'm"", 'spouting', 'nonsense', 'be.', 'thanks', 'reading.', ' ', 'edit:', 'appreciate', 'people', 'helping', 'now,', ""i'm"", 'sorry', 'sounded', 'bit', 'angry', 'post', ""it's"", 'long', 'day.', 'stand', 'though,', 'love', 'opinions', 'any!', ' ', 'understand', ""it's"", 'impossible', 'help', ""there's"", 'far', 'questions', 'people', 'able', 'answer', 'them.', 'personal', 'experience', 'browsing', 'subreddit', 'year', 'feel', 'way', 'currently.', ""i've"", 'read', 'responses', 'appreciate', 'letting', 'this.', '  ', 'reminded', 'me,', 'daily', 'questions', 'thread', 'place', 'post', 'well.', '  ', 'edit:', ""i'm"", 'going', 'bed', ""can't"", 'believe', 'response', 'post', ""i'm"", 'glad', 'stirred', 'genuine', 'discussion', 'topic.', 'think', ""it's"", 'best', 'look', 'sides', 'point', 'view', 'try', 'patient', 'help', 'possible.', 'thanks', 'lot', 'today', 'learned', 'lot', 'pay', 'forward.', '  ', 'e3:', 'okay', 'woke', 'absolutely', 'insane.', 'lot', 'people', 'calling', 'elitist', 'cunt', 'appreciate', 'contribution', 'discussion.', 'thing.', ""i've"", 'found', 'experience', 'easier', 'support', 'advice', 'posting', 'build', 'subs', ' ', 'one.', 'thats', 'pcmr', 'smaller', 'sub,', 'justs', 'frustrated', 'subreddit', 'dedicated', 'helping', 'builds', 'severe', 'lack', 'exactly', 'that.', ""i'm"", 'blaming', 'okay', 'think', ""i'm"", 'elitist', 'thats', 'viewed', 'sub.', 'obviously', 'views', 'shifted', 'thanks', 'discussion', 'going', 'here,', 'thanks', 'participating.']"

buildapc,"Note: Not sure if this is true for any other Windows besides Windows 10, and not sure if this has been fixed already or not (as I haven't enabled it since then).  &nbsp;  Quite a few months ago, I found it weird that my laptop was using around 40-50% of my RAM while idle (no application open at all) out of my 8 GB.  After searching for a bit I saw a possible fix that made no sense for me as ""why would this work"", but indeed it did work. Both to me, and to a friend who also was asking why he was using so much ram. Two others did it and I believe they still saw some ""improvement"" even if not that great.  The fix was very simple for me: to disable Windows tips and tricks.  &nbsp;  To do so, just follow these simple instructions:  &nbsp;   Press the Window key (usually between CTRL and ALT) or click the start icon.   Search for ""Notifications"" and press ""Notifications & actions settings"".   Disable ""Get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows"" by clicking on it.   Restart your computer.  &nbsp;  This worked for us at least, and it went from around 40ish% to 20ish% of RAM usage, to which I believe is where it should be at.  I apologize if this can't be posted here and I apologize if this doesn't work anymore, but hopefully (I think?) it does and it helps someone out.  Cheers.  &nbsp;  EDIT: Woke up and saw I had been gifted gold (my first gold, yey!) and I believe some coins/platinum/premium (I'll still have to check what exactly are those about, not really sure what they are) so thank you a lot gifter! (Don't know if he allows me to say his name so I'll not post it, at least for now).  &nbsp;  Some are saying not to disable this as unused ram is wasted ram. While this is true, to me at least, tips and tricks are also useless so there is no need for me to enable them.  &nbsp;  Other (hopefully) fixes that might be helpful:  &nbsp;   If your disk usage is a lot of times at 100% on idle and you find yourself with office installed, stopping the ""ClickToRun"" (I believe that is the name, don't yet have office installed to confirm) service while not needing to use office might make the 100% usage to stop.   Not sure if it was CPU, RAM or Disk usage regarding Windows Defender, but sometimes it will try to scan it's own folder and will be stuck on a loop while doing so, so you might want (not sure if recommended) to add Windows Defender folder as a folder to not search virus from on Windows Defender Settings (don't remember exactly how you do it but I believe that's what made my friend reduce the usage he had).  &nbsp;  Anyways, regardless of wanting unused RAM or not, hope I helped someone.  &nbsp;  Edit2 Thank you for the platinum kind stranger.","['note:', 'sure', 'true', 'windows', 'windows', '10,', 'sure', 'fixed', '(as', ""haven't"", 'enabled', 'then).', ' ', '&nbsp;', ' ', 'months', 'ago,', 'found', 'weird', 'laptop', '40-50%', 'ram', 'idle', '(no', 'application', 'open', 'all)', '8', 'gb.', ' ', 'searching', 'bit', 'saw', 'possible', 'fix', 'sense', '""why', 'work"",', 'work.', 'me,', 'friend', 'asking', 'ram.', 'believe', 'saw', '""improvement""', 'great.', ' ', 'fix', 'simple', 'me:', 'disable', 'windows', 'tips', 'tricks.', ' ', '&nbsp;', ' ', 'so,', 'follow', 'simple', 'instructions:', ' ', '&nbsp;', '  ', 'press', 'window', 'key', '(usually', 'ctrl', 'alt)', 'click', 'start', 'icon.', '  ', 'search', '""notifications""', 'press', '""notifications', 'actions', 'settings"".', '  ', 'disable', '""get', 'tips,', 'tricks,', 'suggestions', 'use', 'windows""', 'clicking', 'it.', '  ', 'restart', 'computer.', ' ', '&nbsp;', ' ', 'worked', 'least,', 'went', '40ish%', '20ish%', 'ram', 'usage,', 'believe', 'at.', ' ', 'apologize', ""can't"", 'posted', 'apologize', ""doesn't"", 'work', 'anymore,', 'hopefully', '(i', 'think?)', 'helps', 'out.', ' ', 'cheers.', ' ', '&nbsp;', ' ', 'edit:', 'woke', 'saw', 'gifted', 'gold', '(my', 'gold,', 'yey!)', 'believe', 'coins/platinum/premium', ""(i'll"", 'check', 'exactly', 'about,', 'sure', 'are)', 'thank', 'lot', 'gifter!', ""(don't"", 'know', 'allows', ""i'll"", 'post', 'it,', 'now).', ' ', '&nbsp;', ' ', 'saying', 'disable', 'unused', 'ram', 'wasted', 'ram.', 'true,', 'least,', 'tips', 'tricks', 'useless', 'need', 'enable', 'them.', ' ', '&nbsp;', ' ', '(hopefully)', 'fixes', 'helpful:', ' ', '&nbsp;', '  ', 'disk', 'usage', 'lot', 'times', '100%', 'idle', 'find', 'office', 'installed,', 'stopping', '""clicktorun""', '(i', 'believe', 'name,', ""don't"", 'office', 'installed', 'confirm)', 'service', 'needing', 'use', 'office', '100%', 'usage', 'stop.', '  ', 'sure', 'cpu,', 'ram', 'disk', 'usage', 'windows', 'defender,', 'try', 'scan', ""it's"", 'folder', 'stuck', 'loop', 'so,', 'want', '(not', 'sure', 'recommended)', 'add', 'windows', 'defender', 'folder', 'folder', 'search', 'virus', 'windows', 'defender', 'settings', ""(don't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'believe', ""that's"", 'friend', 'reduce', 'usage', 'had).', ' ', '&nbsp;', ' ', 'anyways,', 'regardless', 'wanting', 'unused', 'ram', 'not,', 'hope', 'helped', 'someone.', ' ', '&nbsp;', ' ', 'edit2', 'thank', 'platinum', 'kind', 'stranger.']"

Some points of interest:  Don't bother fanboying over your favourite distro too hard. It won't take long before the next Linux device enters your household and decides to mess with your head by supporting every distro under the sun except your favourite one. Think about it this way: Having access to multiple distributions, all catered to different situations, is way more of a feature than any Windows system could ever hope to achieve.  No seriously Arch fanboys it's time to calm down, I love Arch as much as the next basement dweller but if you stare blindly into the light all it will do is burn out your eyes. What would you do if Arch suddenly disappeared? Install Void Linux and cry on their forums how everything isn't Arch? Like Windows users do on Linux forums? Because they are stuck in their ways? Notice a pattern? Man I talk in too many condescending questions.  The only reason I mentioned Emacs over Vim is because Emacs has superior support in graphical environments, sorry Vim fanboys. Again in 2018 it really won't matter that much because both have large enough bases of support. Whichever gets the job done in the best way possible for you is the one you should go for. You should be enhancing your workflow in whatever way is productive to you.

linux4noobs,"With alarming frequency I see posts on this subreddit involving relatively basic troubleshooting questions from users running Kali Linux. I wrote this as a response to that. I think Kali Linux is great. I just don't think everybody should be using it as a desktop OS.  The TL;DR for this post could be taken straight from the ( ""If you are unfamiliar with Linux generally, if you do not have at least a basic level of competence in administering a system, if you are looking for a Linux distribution to use as a learning tool to get to know your way around Linux, or if you want a distro that you can use as a general purpose desktop installation, Kali Linux is probably not what you are looking for.""  Dear Linux noobs,  Linux is cool. You're interested in Linux and that makes you cool too. You should be proud of your interest in Linux. You're now part of a community that is full of cool people (OK, a few of us are jerks, but what can you do).  What else is cool? Computer hacking. Password cracking. Network penetration. These things are neat, and the people who can do them are usually pretty cool too (though some of them are jerks too). Learning to do these things is fun, and if you want to do it, you should. When practiced responsibly, these things can make fun hobbies, or even a lucrative career. The purpose of this post is not to discourage anybody from learning to do these things.  One of the major problems new Linux users face when starting out is figuring out which Linux distribution is right for them. There are a lot of options after all. Everybody likes to recommend their favorite distro (and also occasionally give their opinion on their least favorite distro). Very frequently I see questions in this subreddit, and in related subreddits, like ""What distro should I use?"", ""I want to learn to code, what distro would be good for me?"", ""What is the best distro for python programming?"", or ""What distro should I use to learn penetration testing?"". New Linux users who might be interested in penetration testing (or some other related topic) might, by some means or another, discover Kali Linux. They might think ""Hey, I want to learn Linux and also pen-testing! I should use Kali Linux."" They'd probably be wrong.  The thing is, most desktop distributions provide access to the same software. If you want to watch Youtube videos and write email, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, etc, are all equally capable of that. If you want to learn python programming, you can do that on any of those distributions. Similarly, if you want to learn pen-testing, you can do it from any of those distributions.  Kali Linux is a distribution specifically designed to be a toolkit for professional pen-testers. As such, it might be very attractive to new Linux users who are interested in security. However, Kali is /not/ designed as a general purpose Linux distro. Some elements of it's design are simply not suited for use as a general purpose desktop. If you're a new Linux user who installs Kali Linux chances are you will have a frustrating experience. The Kali Linux maintainers even have a FAQ page ""Is Kali Linux right for me?""     Please read that article before deciding to use Kali as a desktop OS, especially if you're new to Linux. If you don't yet understand some of the points made in that article that's probably a sign to avoid Kali for now.  It's quite often that I see people asking questions like ""How do I do X in Kali Linux?"" or "" Y is not working. Please help."" Unfortunately these users don't usually get the help they need, which makes me sad. The posts are often dismissed or downvoted. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'd wager that most of the people asking these questions don't need Kali. They need a desktop distribution.  I am worried that if your first adventures with Linux are in Kali you will have a frustrating experience and be turned off from the whole endeavor. Your questions might be dismissed and left unanswered because you appear to be in over your head.  Using Kali Linux as your first desktop Linux distro is like learning to drive on a racecar. Please don't do it.

linux4noobs,"I am disturbed by the number of people in this sub who feel shame for using Ubuntu. Listen up. Ignore whatever you read about Ubuntu not being for pros. IT IS!!  A pro is someone who uses Linux for their profession. I write software for Linux as my job and manage a fleet of thousands of Linux servers, hosting services you've more than likely used. Several of my team members use Ubuntu and we're about as pro as it gets when it comes to Linux. Why? Because it just works. The only reason I don't use Ubuntu is because I prefer Red Hat based systems, so my servers are CentOS and my desktop is Fedora. If they didn't exist, I'd be MORE than happy with Ubuntu.  Linux pros do not want to spend time tinkering with their desktop to make it look pretty. You do that shit when you're just starting out on your Linux journey. Pros use Linux for the power it grants you as a user. Ubuntu gives you the same power as any other distro. Maybe even more so because of how fucking easy it is to use.  Most of the Ubuntu naysayers are amatures who've installed Arch and now think they're experts. Pfffft. Please. Installing Arch is NOTHING SPECIAL!

linux4noobs,"I know we all have our choice of distribution, but when people are asking which distro to use for their first install can we stop recommending Arch or Gentoo, and start recommending actual user friendly distros like Ubuntu and derivatives, Manjaro, Fedora or openSUSE? Forcing a noob to just jump into compiling software from scratch or building their OS from the ground up doesn’t sound like the right thing to do. If we push them into more difficult distributions they might lose confidence if they break something on install and turn their back on Linux for good. If the goal is to get more people to use and stick with Linux why don’t we start recommending user friendly first and then if they request a new distro as a more experienced user then recommend Arch etc.?

linux4noobs,"If you're new to Linux and want to get a solid knowledge of the terminal there is really no better book, that I know of, to get you started than this: [  It's what got me into the Linux world and I haven't looked back ever since. Have read it cover to cover and it's now in its 5th Internet edition. It's often recommended but it would be nice to have a post dedicated to it so here is that post. I'll give a bit of an overview of what the book covers - hopefully, in a way understandable to someone who has no Linux experience.  You'll start off with just basic commands: how to move around directories (folders), how to create and remove files, how to edit text files, etc.. Every concept is represented with concrete examples and terminal output is shown pretty much all the time. Many of the sections have commentary on the history of those programs/tools and it's very entertaining and helps to keep things interesting.  As your knowledge progresses you'll be introduced to more programs/tools and learn how  to build your own tools by leveraging a core idea that is central to Linux: using programs/tools that were made to solve very specific problems and leveraging Linux's extremely powerful I/O redirection abilities to make those programs communicate with each other to perform increasingly complex tasks.  Eventually, you'll be taught how to write 'scripts' (basically small programs) that will allow you to forego interactive use of the programs/tools you've learned to use earlier and will enable you to automate just about everything you can think of.  There are a lot of links provided to further reading on just about every topic.

linux4noobs,"( really blew up, so I thought that I would post an update in case anybody was curious.  I expected this subreddit to tear me apart for being negative about their beloved Linux but the vast majority of what I got instead was understanding and support.  So as  much as I wanted to be an Arch badass like everybody else, I decided to make my life easier and just try striaght up Ubuntu 19.10  And it has been AWESOME!!  Now granted, a lot of that is because of everything that I've already learned so far. But for the most part, it Just Works ™  Conky works better than any other distro I've tried (they would all minimise it if I push Super + D, but on Ubuntu it works properly), TeamViewer which for some reason was compeltely broken on other distros just works perfectly without doing anything special. My brightness buttons work just fine (because why wouldn't they!?!?), hell, even my fingerprint sensor works!  Now some things were a bit different and I still had to Google a bunch of stuff. But instead of digging deep and going through tons of trial and error, the answers are easy to find and work on the first try.  Now customization-wise it is definitely much more limited than other KDE-based things, but I would definitely rather struggle with tinkering than struggle with functioning.

linux4noobs,"First off, I love a lot of things about Linux. The speed, the customization, workspaces are awesome, and I actually love using the terminal. It's so fast and I actually find it fun to navigate using the keyboard, rsync is amazing, and I love writing scripts like my own little mini-programs.  But it just seems like every single thing I try to do required an hour of Googling and trial & error.  Right off the bat, WiFi didn't work. I scoured the internet and eventually found that if I installed a specific driver and a specific kernel and a specific header then it would all work. Luckily I could USB tether from my phone to get that all done and it worked!  I better make a backup of my system and those drivers and stuff! Pop in a flash drive and nothing happens. Off to Google to learn how to mount it in the terminal.   Then I wanted it to mount my NAS automatically on boot, but I had a lot of problems with it trying and failing to do that before being connected to the network. Again, a TON of searching and trying all kinds of variations in the fstab before I found the right combination of arguments to make it work.  Then the computer would just randomly freeze sometimes. Completely unrecoverable. I couldn't really track this one down so I decided to try a different distro.  Redo all of the stuff I did before on the new distro (which was pretty easy because I had backups) Then after doing all this work I restarted and just got a blaack screen after logging in. Back to Google and I eventually find that with this distro I need to add ""nomodeset"" to grub. Whew, we're back in.  Then I constantly get some popup wanting to connect to an external display that doesn't exist? Back to Google, find some service to shut off to make that go away.  Then I like having Remote Desktop software so that I can control my computer from other computers or my phone. So I install TeamViewer but most of the buttons in the app don't do anything when I click on them, I can't log in. Tried Googling that for a while but couldn't figure it out. So I tried Chrome Remote Desktop instead, get it installed fine but then I get an error message/crash when I connect. More searching and I find some obscure file that I need to create to get that working.  And now the last straw is that the brightness controls don't work. I push the function keys on the laptop and the slider pops up on the display and moves but the brightness doesn't change. I've probably spent about 4 hours trying to find a solution to this one but nothing works.  I've been through four distros now because I keep running into different unfixable issues and now this might be the end of this one too.  Again, I absolutely love the things that work, when they work, but this is just exhausting, I spend all of my time fixing my computer instead of using it.  TL;DR: Even single little thing I do requires and hour of Googling and trial & error to make work. Does it ever end!?  EDIT: This subreddit is pretty great.

linux4noobs,"I've seen more than a few replies on this sub that are sarcastic, derisive, dismissive, and just unfriendly. I mean, it's the internet, we can expect that, and there has always been a ""RTFM"" attitude within the linux community.

pcgamingtechsupport,"Update (20 July): I have learned of an alternate solution to fix this problem, which does not require having to download anything and does not appear to cause problems with any other games (e.g. BioShock). As of now I believe this should be the preferred solution. See ""Option #1"" below for the update.  &nbsp;  tl;dr: The ""Games Explorer"" hub in Windows 7 and Vista is preventing older PC games from launching. Check the list of symptoms below. You can fix it by making a single change in your Windows registry - see Option #1.  &nbsp;  In the last few weeks, Microsoft shut down servers related to the (#Games_Explorer) feature in Windows 7 and Vista (possibly related to the end-of-life ( for the integrated Internet Games service). As a result, there are a ton of older PC games that will not run anymore on those operating systems.  When you launch one of these games, the gameux.dll file in Windows' System32 or SysWOW64 directory tries to contact Microsoft's servers in order to update the game's profile in Games Explorer. The game will not start until the profile update is complete. Since the relevant servers are offline now, the update will never happen.  This problem affects hundreds of popular games. In my testing I have found titles that were released from 1998 through 2006.  &nbsp;  The symptoms of this problem are:  - The game window does not appear after launching it, but the game's executable does not crash and there is no error message.     (If you ARE getting an error message, then you have an unrelated problem and these solutions will not fix it.)  - When you launch the game, a rundll32.exe process is started and visible in Task Manager, which is using about 8 MB of RAM and also appears to be frozen. - If you add the Command Line column to Task Manager, you can see that the target of rundll32.exe is C:\Windows\System32\gameux.dll or C:\Windows\SysWOW64\gameux.dll  &nbsp;  There are two ways to fix this:  &nbsp;  Option #1 (recommended)  The best solution I know of is to modify the Windows registry so that Games Explorer points to a ( - meaning your own computer - instead of Microsoft's servers. I found this solution on GOG's troubleshooting ( who grabbed it from a user in their (  Here are the steps to take:  - Open the Registry Editor. You can find it by searching for ""Registry Editor"" (without quotes) in the Start Menu. - In the left side of the Registry Editor, navigate to the following folder:      Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\GameUX\ServiceLocation  - Create a backup by right-clicking the ServiceLocation folder and selecting Export.      Give it a name like ""Games Explorer backup"" (without quotes) and save it somewhere on your hard drive, in case you need to undo the changes.  - Now in the right side of the Registry Editor, right-click Games and select Modify. - In the Value Data box, delete the current entry and replace it with 127.0.0.1 - Then click OK and close the Registry Editor. - You may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.  &nbsp;  Option #2  If Option #1 doesn't work or you'd rather not modify the Windows registry, you can simply disable both of the gameux.dll files instead.  The gameux.dll files are only used for Games Explorer, so disabling them is completely safe. Someone created a batch file in 2012 that will do this easily, and it is reversible by running the file again.  There is at least one game - the original version of BioShock - that won't run if gameux.dll is disabled, so re-enabling the files may be necessary.  I did not find any other other games with this requirement after spending a few hours testing and searching the internet, but if you happen to come across any, please leave a comment to let me know (launching the game should give you an error message that says ""Failed to create the GameExplorer object"" or something similar).  ( that has the needed file (download link is about 2/3 of the way down).  ( (Google Drive)  - Extract GameUxFixed-Ubeogesh.bat from the archive to a temporary folder. - Run it, then press any key to apply the patch. If you get an error message about not having ownership privileges, run it again by right-clicking and selecting ""Run as administrator."" - You might need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. - Run the .bat file again to undo the changes, if necessary.  &nbsp;  I originally learned about this problem through ( on GOG, which also points to a number of other sources with more details. ( on superuser.com was particularly helpful for me, and I also learned that this has been an issue with Windows since at least (  &nbsp;  Here is a partial list of affected games that I have tested on my Windows 7 PC (reports added from other users are noted). Each game was tested using the current build on Steam or GOG:  - Age of Wonders 1, 2, and Shadow Magic - Arx Fatalis - Battlefield 2 (reported working by u/Svetimsalis) - Blitzkrieg Anthology 1 and 2

Let me preface the current situation by mentioning me having a lot of bad luck (had a CPU that was dead on arrival, a faulty Motherboard etc.) and ongoing problems with my PC, therefore naming him ""Beast"" since he seems to be unruly as fuck.  I built this rig back in march and after sorting out all the faulty hardware I, for whatever reason, got when buying all my shit the rig ran fine for a few weeks, but then blue screens started to appear. Not one, but many. The PC crashes every time whether before the Windows Startup screen or right when I entered my password and it's checking if it's valid. It then stopped for a few weeks, and re-appeared. This kept going on over the year but I was always like ""give 'em a bit of time, don't be too pushy"" and lo behold - at some point he ran fine.  Only to now start messing with me again.. but I'm fed up, really. I since started studying VFX / 3D Animation and need this workstation working properly whenever I need it to. So please, if you could help me that'd be wonderful.  I googled the shit out of all those error messages but all I get is ""deinstall third party software"".. thing is; the problem existed before installing anything other than Windows, too. I also reinstalled Windows a couple of times. Still the same.  &nbsp;  Issue  &nbsp;  Keeps crashing and having blue screens with different error codes. The rig starts in safe mode, though. This problem is not reproducable since the rig kind of decides when to mess up itself.  &nbsp;  Error-Codes:  &nbsp;  IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL  &nbsp;  PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA &nbsp;   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED  &nbsp;  SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION  &nbsp;  KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE  &nbsp;  Attempts to Fix the Problem  &nbsp;  1.

pcgamingtechsupport,"I think I may have finally gone off the deep end with these 2080ti cards and EVGA.        I'm going to try to keep this short, but please forgive me if I write too much.         I get a 2080ti 6/7 months ago. 1 dead fan. RMA it.        2nd card works great for 6/7 months.        Both of these cards came in brand new, retail packaging.        2nd card had a random 'flicker' that was different than a standard black screen, it was a broken up image.        \-Existed since the beginning but was getting worse.       RMA 2nd card about a month ago.       \-Queue insanity origins-         3rd card arrives and lasts 8 days. Artifacts.        4th card arrives and lasts 14 days. Artifacts.         Multiple support threads all over. Mixed opinions, GPU and others PSU.       Replace my PSU and install 5th card. Lasts 1-2 days then starts crashing. Event ID 13.         Investigate and find nearly 20,000 Event ID 13 logs from exact date of 3rd card arrival.      100-200 of these logs would generate every time the game artifacted/froze and needed reboot.        The other two actually artifacted but this one did not and still has not.        I make an acronis back up image, reset all CPU/memory O/C (stable for 1.5+ years) get a brand new O/S installed, get all updates and DDU nvidia drivers on a fresh O/S to be extremely safe, especially concerning Windows Update and blocked internet upon reboot.         As soon as nvidia drivers installed, black screen. Reboot. Red screen of death after Windows login screen.       Windows 10 Red Screen of Death. That's new.... google results in, 'check oc' 'bad gpu' 'bad factory oc' etc etc.       Underclock core/memory by a few hundred and oh wow, everything is back to normal. Maybe EVGA did bad OC, no wories, I'll just go fully insane and keep this card underclocked.         Maybe 20-30 minutes of Division 2 and same issues again.          Frustrated, restore Acronis image and game on HD 630, onboard GPU built into 7700k CPU.         Hours and hours go by. Run a Heaven benchmark for 5 hours, all good.       Put in a GTX 1050 that was used previously around 3rd/4th card as a backup GPU. Again, Division 2 and Heaven pass several hour points with ZERO issues.        Lose my shit at 'nuclear option' version 2 suggestion. They suggest to re-do all O/S and factory oc, etc etc.        Also suggest that my UPS, battery backup that's been running for over a year, may be an issue.         Buy a brand new RX 580 from Amazon PrimeNow. Play Division 2 for 3 hours. Follow up with a 6 hour long benchmark in Heaven. Everything is still going strong.          So I don't understand how 3 different GPU can work in the same exact hardware, setup, cables, everything... but still somehow... my computer is the issue. Oh no.. my O/S is the issue.. Oh no.. my PSU is the issue.. Oh no.. my UPS battery back up is the issue..          I would be more inclined to believe them if this was a new/recent 2080ti purchase but no... the 2nd replacement they sent me worked for 6/7 months. It was RMAd for a stupid rare flicker. THEY DIDNT EVEN FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT! I've actually requested it back as at this point, flickering is much better than this nightmare.          My question is, have I missed something crucial? How the fuck could 3 different GPU work with the same exact setup? How could this seriously be anything other than EVGA cucking me around with 3 refurbished units instead of a brand new one for a $1250 product I purchased new? Am I just fucking insane?","['think', 'finally', 'gone', 'deep', 'end', '2080ti', 'cards', 'evga.', '       ', ""i'm"", 'going', 'try', 'short,', 'forgive', 'write', 'much.', '        ', '2080ti', '6/7', 'months', 'ago.', '1', 'dead', 'fan.', 'rma', 'it.', '       ', '2nd', 'card', 'works', 'great', '6/7', 'months.', '       ', 'cards', 'came', 'brand', 'new,', 'retail', 'packaging.', '       ', '2nd', 'card', 'random', ""'flicker'"", 'different', 'standard', 'black', 'screen,', 'broken', 'image.', '       ', '\\-existed', 'beginning', 'getting', 'worse.', '      ', 'rma', '2nd', 'card', 'month', 'ago.', '      ', '\\-queue', 'insanity', 'origins-', '        ', '3rd', 'card', 'arrives', 'lasts', '8', 'days.', 'artifacts.', '       ', '4th', 'card', 'arrives', 'lasts', '14', 'days.', 'artifacts.', '        ', 'multiple', 'support', 'threads', 'over.', 'mixed', 'opinions,', 'gpu', 'psu.', '      ', 'replace', 'psu', 'install', '5th', 'card.', 'lasts', '1-2', 'days', 'starts', 'crashing.', 'event', 'id', '13.', '        ', 'investigate', 'find', 'nearly', '20,000', 'event', 'id', '13', 'logs', 'exact', 'date', '3rd', 'card', 'arrival.', '     ', '100-200', 'logs', 'generate', 'time', 'game', 'artifacted/froze', 'needed', 'reboot.', '       ', 'actually', 'artifacted', 'not.', '       ', 'acronis', 'image,', 'reset', 'cpu/memory', 'o/c', '(stable', '1.5+', 'years)', 'brand', 'new', 'o/s', 'installed,', 'updates', 'ddu', 'nvidia', 'drivers', 'fresh', 'o/s', 'extremely', 'safe,', 'especially', 'concerning', 'windows', 'update', 'blocked', 'internet', 'reboot.', '        ', 'soon', 'nvidia', 'drivers', 'installed,', 'black', 'screen.', 'reboot.', 'red', 'screen', 'death', 'windows', 'login', 'screen.', '      ', 'windows', '10', 'red', 'screen', 'death.', ""that's"", 'new....', 'google', 'results', 'in,', ""'check"", ""oc'"", ""'bad"", ""gpu'"", ""'bad"", 'factory', ""oc'"", 'etc', 'etc.', '      ', 'underclock', 'core/memory', 'oh', 'wow,', 'normal.', 'maybe', 'evga', 'bad', 'oc,', 'wories,', ""i'll"", 'fully', 'insane', 'card', 'underclocked.', '        ', 'maybe', '20-30', 'minutes', 'division', '2', 'issues', 'again.', '         ', 'frustrated,', 'restore', 'acronis', 'image', 'game', 'hd', '630,', 'onboard', 'gpu', 'built', '7700k', 'cpu.', '        ', 'hours', 'hours', 'by.', 'run', 'heaven', 'benchmark', '5', 'hours,', 'good.', '      ', 'gtx', '1050', 'previously', '3rd/4th', 'card', 'backup', 'gpu.', 'again,', 'division', '2', 'heaven', 'pass', 'hour', 'points', 'zero', 'issues.', '       ', 'lose', 'shit', ""'nuclear"", ""option'"", 'version', '2', 'suggestion.', 'suggest', 're-do', 'o/s', 'factory', 'oc,', 'etc', 'etc.', '       ', 'suggest', 'ups,', 'battery', 'backup', ""that's"", 'running', 'year,', 'issue.', '        ', 'buy', 'brand', 'new', 'rx', '580', 'amazon', 'primenow.', 'play', 'division', '2', '3', 'hours.', 'follow', '6', 'hour', 'long', 'benchmark', 'heaven.', 'going', 'strong.', '         ', ""don't"", 'understand', '3', 'different', 'gpu', 'work', 'exact', 'hardware,', 'setup,', 'cables,', 'everything...', 'somehow...', 'computer', 'issue.', 'oh', 'no..', 'o/s', 'issue..', 'oh', 'no..', 'psu', 'issue..', 'oh', 'no..', 'ups', 'battery', 'issue..', '         ', 'inclined', 'believe', 'new/recent', '2080ti', 'purchase', 'no...', '2nd', 'replacement', 'sent', 'worked', '6/7', 'months.', 'rmad', 'stupid', 'rare', 'flicker.', 'didnt', 'find', 'wrong', 'it!', ""i've"", 'actually', 'requested', 'point,', 'flickering', 'better', 'nightmare.', '         ', 'question', 'is,', 'missed', 'crucial?', 'fuck', '3', 'different', 'gpu', 'work', 'exact', 'setup?', 'seriously', 'evga', 'cucking', '3', 'refurbished', 'units', 'instead', 'brand', 'new', '$1250', 'product', 'purchased', 'new?', 'fucking', 'insane?']"

pcgamingtechsupport,"I sold my delidded i7-7700K online, and wrote five pages (1700 words) worth of instructions to the person who purchased it, with several links to guides and video tutorials that he could follow.  For practical reasons, I never resealed the processor, and shipped it along with the remaining Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut that I'd used. I specifically told the buyer that if it weren't enough to cover the die and the inside of the IHS (a third-party 100% copper one that I also included in his order), he'd have to buy additional liquid metal, for proper coverage.  Apparently, my warnings didn’t suffice, as he claimed that there was insufficient liquid metal, and not only YOLO'd it on the die alone, but also ran a bunch of games without even checking the temperatures of the cores using HWiNFO64, as I had suggested (a 3-5C difference between cores if fine - 8-10C or more is not fine). ~~Now, he's telling me that only 2c/4t are showing up in Task Manager and CPU-Z.~~  ~~Did he fry the remaining cores/threads? The processor shows up correctly in his BIOS (Asus Prime B250M mobo - which revision is a mystery to me), and I already ran him through the msconfig settings (""Normal startup"" and unchecked ""Number of processors"" under Boot Advanced Options).~~  ~~What else is there to do? He said his BIOS is updated to the latest version, and he also reset it to its factory settings.~~  UPDATE: He followed my msconfig/BIOS instructions once more (correctly, this time) and all 4c/8t are now showing up. However, his idle temps are concerning me. (  I feel like he should take the processor out and apply the liquid metal again (on both the die and the IHS, as I made perfectly clear from the beginning), but I'm afraid he may screw up things even more, somehow. What do you all think? He only cares about gaming.  UPDATE #2: Thanks for the answers, everyone. I did my best in instructing him prior to the sale, going as far as saying that he didn't seem to be the ideal candidate for handling a delidded CPU, and should stick to factory sealed ones, instead. He still went ahead with the purchase.  Now, after helping the buyer fix the lacking cores/threads issue, I said that whatever happens to his processor is out of my control. I did my part in selling a fully functional product, and thoroughly emphasized all the risks involved, not to mention the correct procedures. It's up to him to follow them and take good care of his CPU.  UPDATE #3: To clarify even further, I did let him know that, while still within Intel's ""safe"" standards, his temps were a bit too high (especially after he shared an actual ( and my personal recommendation was to buy some more Conductonaut and apply the liquid metal again, making sure to follow all of my instructions the second time.  He agreed and was very understanding, thanking me and saying that he'd positively qualify the sale.

pcgamingtechsupport,"Hi everyone  I have discovered a simple way to copy games downloaded using the new Xbox (Beta) app from one PC to another. I often need to do this as I have terribly slow, capped home internet. I hope this can help anyone else in this situation.  This guide is specifically for Win32 games packaged as Windows Store apps. Think games like Tomb Raider and Wolfenstein, but not special ""Windows 10"" versions like Superhot: Windows 10 or State of Decay 2. For those UWP games, if you can't find them in the MSIXVC folder, please see my other guide linked below.  You will want to start by downloading the game of choice on PC 1. The game will be downloaded into `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\MSIXVC` on your OS drive, or `Z:\WindowsApps\MSIXVC` on any other drive. Once downloaded, you will need administrator privileges to gain access to this folder, the easiest way is to double click > Continue > click the security tab link, then change owner to yourself, close the security window, double click again, Continue. You will have to do this for both the WindowsApps and MSIXVC folders.  Before copying anything to PC 2, start by downloading a couple megabytes of the game on the target PC, just enough so the Xbox app creates the target folder and files on PC 2. You will want to repeat the same process above of taking ownership of the WindowsApps and MSIXVC folders.  You will notice the apps are represented as groups of three files, each starting with a long ID string. The files are <ID> with no extension, which is the main game file, <ID>.xvi (unknown), and <ID>.xvs, which contains some metadata about the game. You can open this <ID>.xvs file in Notepad or Notepad++ to check which game ID you want to copy over (it's just a JSON file so pasting it in an online JSON formatter can make it easier to read). The game ID will be the same between PC 1 and PC 2.  Now, you're almost ready to copy. However, make sure to close the Xbox app (and kill it from Task Manager for good measure) on the target PC to ensure it doesn't have a lock on the files, otherwise you won't be able to overwrite them. Now, you should be able to copy all 3 files with the given ID from PC 1 to PC 2 using your preferred method (direct Ethernet cable is probably fastest).  Then, simply open up the Xbox app again, and resume the download. It should immediately jump up to Downloading 100%, then install the game for you.  I was worried this would be a complex process like it is for Windows store apps (see my post here:  [ but it's almost as straightforward as copying Steam games. Hopefully Microsoft adds an official way to do this as the app gets closer to a 1.0 release.","['hi', ' ', 'discovered', 'simple', 'way', 'copy', 'games', 'downloaded', 'new', 'xbox', '(beta)', 'app', 'pc', 'another.', 'need', 'terribly', 'slow,', 'capped', 'home', 'internet.', 'hope', 'help', 'situation.', ' ', 'guide', 'specifically', 'win32', 'games', 'packaged', 'windows', 'store', 'apps.', 'think', 'games', 'like', 'tomb', 'raider', 'wolfenstein,', 'special', '""windows', '10""', 'versions', 'like', 'superhot:', 'windows', '10', 'state', 'decay', '2.', 'uwp', 'games,', ""can't"", 'find', 'msixvc', 'folder,', 'guide', 'linked', 'below.', ' ', 'want', 'start', 'downloading', 'game', 'choice', 'pc', '1.', 'game', 'downloaded', '`c:\\program', 'files\\windowsapps\\msixvc`', 'os', 'drive,', '`z:\\windowsapps\\msixvc`', 'drive.', 'downloaded,', 'need', 'administrator', 'privileges', 'gain', 'access', 'folder,', 'easiest', 'way', 'double', 'click', '>', 'continue', '>', 'click', 'security', 'tab', 'link,', 'change', 'owner', 'yourself,', 'close', 'security', 'window,', 'double', 'click', 'again,', 'continue.', 'windowsapps', 'msixvc', 'folders.', ' ', 'copying', 'pc', '2,', 'start', 'downloading', 'couple', 'megabytes', 'game', 'target', 'pc,', 'xbox', 'app', 'creates', 'target', 'folder', 'files', 'pc', '2.', 'want', 'repeat', 'process', 'taking', 'ownership', 'windowsapps', 'msixvc', 'folders.', ' ', 'notice', 'apps', 'represented', 'groups', 'files,', 'starting', 'long', 'id', 'string.', 'files', '<id>', 'extension,', 'main', 'game', 'file,', '<id>.xvi', '(unknown),', '<id>.xvs,', 'contains', 'metadata', 'game.', 'open', '<id>.xvs', 'file', 'notepad', 'notepad++', 'check', 'game', 'id', 'want', 'copy', ""(it's"", 'json', 'file', 'pasting', 'online', 'json', 'formatter', 'easier', 'read).', 'game', 'id', 'pc', '1', 'pc', '2.', ' ', 'now,', ""you're"", 'ready', 'copy.', 'however,', 'sure', 'close', 'xbox', 'app', '(and', 'kill', 'task', 'manager', 'good', 'measure)', 'target', 'pc', 'ensure', ""doesn't"", 'lock', 'files,', ""won't"", 'able', 'overwrite', 'them.', 'now,', 'able', 'copy', '3', 'files', 'given', 'id', 'pc', '1', 'pc', '2', 'preferred', 'method', '(direct', 'ethernet', 'cable', 'probably', 'fastest).', ' ', 'then,', 'simply', 'open', 'xbox', 'app', 'again,', 'resume', 'download.', 'immediately', 'jump', 'downloading', '100%,', 'install', 'game', 'you.', ' ', 'worried', 'complex', 'process', 'like', 'windows', 'store', 'apps', '(see', 'post', 'here:', ' ', ""it's"", 'straightforward', 'copying', 'steam', 'games.', 'hopefully', 'microsoft', 'adds', 'official', 'way', 'app', 'gets', 'closer', '1.0', 'release.']"
pcgamingtechsupport,"I built my first pc two months ago, and it ran great for the first week. I could definitely notice the difference between 240 frames vs console frames. However, since then my pc’s performance has deteriorated greatly. My FPS counter remains as advertised, but I know that I’m not actually getting 240 frames; it feels more like 60-80 fps. I’ve ran 3D mark tests, hw info tests, cpu-z, gpu z, and ran memtest 64 all night long with no errors or issues. I reinstalled windows and removed all drivers with ddu. When I took these last steps my pc briefly returned to its original performance for about 45 mins, and then started performing poorly again. All the numbers on those tests I mentioned were good or great. My monitor is brand new as well.  I also tried switching surge protectors, and this also improved my performance for about 45 mins.  It's just bizarre how my pc responds to things.  For example, whenever I download a certain software or use a software I haven't used in a while my performance will improve for a few minutes.  I've also replaced my motherboard and borrowed RAM sticks from a friend.  When I first installed the motherboard it seemed like everything was back to normal, but again this only lasted for a day or so.  When I used a friends RAM my pc ran much better for about half a day.  It seems like every time something new is introduced to the pc, whether it is software or hardware, the performance will improve depending on how important whatever I added was.  I also setup in a different room, and again my performance improved for about 30 minutes.  Other weird things that improve performance temporarily include opening monitoring software like MSI afterburner.  I know it’s unlikely, but could the electricity from my outlet be causing this issue?  I don’t want to drag my rig to someone else’s place unless this is actually a plausible cause. Sorry for the long read.  My cpu clocks never fluctuate from 4100 mhz, and my gpu clocks only ever drop down from 2005 mhz to 1995 mhz.  [  3D mark temps:  [  3D mark results: [  Edit: I ran malwarebytes as well on the off chance that I somehow had a virus, but it didn't detect anything. Just a little baffled at this point, and want to inquire about this before I haul it off to my microcenter.  Edit:  I forgot to mention that when I unplug my computer completley for a day or so it will perform well for the first half hour that I'm playing.  When I don't unplug it overnight, the performance is awful from the rip.

talesfromtechsupport,"I was thrust a laptop by an angry exec early this morning with him complaining that his laptop had locked up again. Normally we have a ticketing system in place for any and all tech issues. However when an exec wants something he bypasses the system because of RHIP. So I go through the normal routine of diagnosis and through my efforts I see that the issue is simply bad ram. I replace the ram and take the unit back to the exec.   He tells me he refuses to take the unit unless I have made 100 percent sure that everything that was wrong with it is fixed. Internally I wanted to punch this man but I held it in and simply asked him what other issues he was having and pulled out a notepad. He ran through a load of issues that all screamed ""just run fkin ccleaner"" to me and I took his unit back to my desk.   After going through and cleaning out BS installed programs used literally once and never again and cleaning out junk data, I found that a folder in his roaming was reading 12GB but was hidden. I log in with my creds and enable viewing hidden or protected files and I see that the hidden folder was from 2014. Basically it was just a bunch of pictures and looked to be a temp folder created by one of the old programs I removed. Some kind of picture manager or some such.   Normally when we see personal pictures on the machine we are supposed to delete them immediately. Now no one EVER does this as we are not that big of dicks in the IT dept. Plus this guy was an exec so I decided to just move the pictures to his desktop under a folder I created called Old Pics.   I took the laptop to him and informed him of the pics telling him I left it up to him if he wanted them deleted or not. He thanked me for my time and I went back to work.   About an hour later him and his wife, who had come up to join him for lunch, came over to my desk. He seemed very happy and she was crying.   Now normally when I have nothing to do and a boss comes over, I stand up to greet them. Just the way I was raised I guess. I was not prepared for what followed and was totally shocked by the outcome.   The lady wanted to thank me for finding the pictures and the exec reached out to shake my hand thanking me profusely before pulling me into a hug in front of the entire IT department. I awkwardly hugged him back and he let me go embarrassed. My eyes are wide flabbergasted and totally unprepared for this, extremely, out of character moment from this guy.   Barely able to hold back the tears, his wife tells me that the pictures I recovered were thought to be lost. In 2012 their 4 year old son had died of lukemia and the pictures I recovered were taken right before his diagnosis at 3 years of age. Because of a  house fire a few years ago they thought they lost every last photo of their son. Apparently those were the photos I had recovered.   His wife reached out to hug me and everyone in the IT department stared at their screens hard with puffy eyes as we were all not expecting this kind of emotional event today.  My boss came out of his office to personally thank me and forwarded an email chain to me ahead of a company wide email that the CEO sent out basically retelling the tale while naming me personally. He threw in words about striving for excellence and the unexpected results of every day excellence.   I had to turn off my skype for business as the attaboys kept coming in one after the other. My boss told me to take my lunch early since the flood of messages was making it hard to do my job.   EDIT: Post this before lunch one day, don't log into reddit for a bit, realize post went nuclear.

talesfromtechsupport,"I work in a store that offers technical support for consumer-level technology.  A few days ago I had an elderly gentleman that we'll call Pete (name changed for privacy). Our receptionist made him a walk-in appointment earlier that day and I ended up taking it. When I opened it all up, the only notes I saw were ""Third-party software, hard of hearing.""  I walked up to Pete and greeted him, saw that he was staring at my lips as to read them, then I asked if he knew American Sign Language (ASL). I've been trying to learn ASL it as a sort of side-hobby for a few months now. Pete signs ""yes"" and we continue the conversation in Sign. Turns out the issue is with Skype, which keeps crashing on his roughly 5-year old tablet, and he's been having difficulty video-calling his wife who is Deaf.  She lives in a different continent, she travelled there for a temporary work opportunity and would be there for two years. This being the mid-way point, it's now been 1 year since Pete's seen his wife. Skype is the only way they both know how to communicate efficiently long-distance, as neither are comfortable with email or other text-based services.  As I go through verifying that he knows his password and making sure there's a backup of his device, Pete and I are signing back and forth and his face was completely lit up. I felt so good to be able to, albeit slowly, speak with him in his language and give him the time he deserved, even if his reason for visiting us had little to do with our physical product.  Once everything was verified and backed up, I uninstalled Skype and reinstalled it, had Pete sign in, and use Skype's test call to ensure it wouldn't crash (as it would immediately upon call creation before). Test call went through fine. Sweet.  I looked down to write a few extra notes and began to hear some coughs. I looked up and there was Pete, crying while waving to his wife through Skype. Pete called her and she picked up! He introduced me to her and told me that it'd been 3-weeks since they'd heard from each other. I stepped away to give him a moment alone.  It's moments like these that keep me going as a technician. Even though I barely touched Pete's tablet, ""fixing"" it made me feel like a hero. It's been a few days and I can still see his smile.  Just thought I'd share, thanks for reading.  Obligatory: Wow, this exploded overnight! Thank you all for your kind words.

talesfromtechsupport,"I work as an Executive Support Technician for a large company, I have a team of 8 people under me and we support high ranking executives and their administrative assistants.   Because of the nature of our work, we have the ability to ""get things done"" that the standard help desk cannot, We can force upgrades that would otherwise be denied, get things expedited, skip the normal procedures and talk directly with the people who fix the issues.    While we are executive support, there are still levels, when the CEO is in town, one of us is camped outside of where ever he might be in case there is any sort of issue.   For lower people, we make sure things get done as quick as possible, but it's not a drop everything situation.  As we prepped for the releases of the new iPhones, we braced for the flood of ""I NEED this"" that inevitably happens.  We slot in orders immediately for the top of the pyramid guys, and then work our way down, replacing, or sometimes having to tell them that they have to wait because the device they have is too new to warrant replacing.   So on Monday, the EA of a lower end Exec put in a request to get both herself and the exec new 256 Gig iPhone X's  The Exec was put on the approval list, with a wait, but the EA was denied.  She had just been issued an iPhone 7 a few months ago, and she began to raise hell about ""I have to support him, so I need to have the exact same phone etc etc""   Still denied.  On Tuesday, I get a ticket from the EA - iPhone will not turn on, require replacement with attached ticket for iPhone X request.  I send one of my drones out to investigate and I immediately get a text saying I have to get out there, I get out there and the iPhone is wet, not just wet, but dripping wet, like just pulled out of a glass of water wet with a screen that could only be called heavily Cracked.  the EA states ""I was using it and it fell into my water bottle""   So we take the phone back to our area and I've called my manager over and we explain it, It's obvious what has happened,  We've toweled it off and when we turn it over, water drizzles out of the cracked screen.   Well as luck would have it, we have spares, so I pluck a nice 64 gig Rose Gold iPhone 6s that was returned when the previous owner departed the company, I call and have the sim reprovisioned, I re-assign the phone in Airwatch and I have the phone returned to the EA.  10 minutes later, said EA is at our door, ranting, screaming saying that she can't work like this, she needs a new phone and if we don't give her one ""EXECUTIVE"" will make us give her one.  I step in and tell her ""A permanent replacement is just beginning the process, we have had to issue you this phone as a loaner so you can continue working until a permanent replacement is sourced""  Queue Wednesday, the approval process has come back denied for her replacement, the loaner phone is now her permanent phone.  This info is relayed to the EA, who is fuming, lots of ""EXECUTIVE WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS"" and statements of ""I can't believe this is happening to me, how will I work?""   Wednesday afternoon, same EA, new ticket - iPhone broken, need replacement.  I head out myself to see the issue and the phone looks like it was dragged behind a semi truck for 100 miles, the screen is shattered, a big chunk missing out the top near the camera, big dents in the back.  I calmly ask ""What happened? This phone was perfect this morning?""  The reply: ""Well, since you gave me an old phone, my case didn't fit and it slipped out of my hands and fell down the stairs.""  Well ok, could you tell me when and what stairwell this happened? she does, and I take the mangled phone, I grab my manager and we head off to the security office, and we pull the tapes.  On the video we see the EA walking up the stairwell (concrete stairs, metal hand rail, your typical big building non public stairwell) she reaches the top and proceeds to fling the phone, like one would skip a stone, down from the 6floor to the mid floor landing, where it lands, she steps on it and then kicks it down to the 5th floor, it bangs off the metal fire door and she picks it up, examines it and then tosses it down the stairs to towards the 4th floor, bouncing off a few steps before landing on the mid landing between 5 and 4.  She picks the device up, and pries a large section of something off the phone (We suspect this was the chunk missing by the camera) and then heads back up the stairs, running the phone against the cinder block wall as she climbs.   So we grab a copy of the video, we head straight to HR, we sit with the personnel director, we show her the video, we show her the 2 damaged iPhones, we show her the tickets, I relay the abuse thrown to myself and my techs about how she demands an iPhone X and has taken to destroying company property to get it.   Termination follows, however the user has gone home for the day, her accounts are disabled, her security badge flagged.    7:30 am today, the EA attempts to get into the building and her badge does not work, so she has to walk to the security office, the security officer takes the badge, and walks her to HR.  8 am, the Security officer and two members of HR are escorting the EA out of the building, she's alternating between yelling and crying, Demanding that EXECUTIVE be called and that she's being framed.  As she's brought through the main foyer, I'm on the 2nd floor balcony that overlooks the entrance, she looks up at me, curses me and is gone.  Both phones, her laptop and other equipment have been placed with the Legal team as a precaution. Company policy when there is a messy separation.  Maybe I'll buy my team pizza for lunch today, seems like the right thing to do.  TLDR; Executive Assistant breaks iPhones in her quest to get an iPhone X, gets unemployment instead.

talesfromtechsupport,"LTL FTP, etc.This happened last year, but a recent post elsewhere sparked the memory  Little Background: I work IT at my college, usually I work in back so I don't have to deal with people, but once a week I get to grace the helpdesk. My school gives it's students a lot of privacy and they can decide what the school can release to other people when they come for orientation, it ranges from we're an open book to we can't verify the students existance. This student selected, we cannot verfy his existance which applies to everyone that is not an immediate family member.   So be me, bored out of my skull watching the minutes tick by of the last 5 minutes of my shift, ready to get dinner. I get a call from whom shall be known as $apache (very agressive helicopter parent, hence attack helicopter).   $me: Thank you for calling $myschool ITS help desk how can I help you   $apache: Hello! My name is $Apache and my son goes to the school, but is having trouble logging in to $ouronlinepanelforstudents can you give me his password?   $me: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble however we do not keep students passwords on record, however if he is having issues with it he can reset it online, call us, or come down to $buildingwe'rein to come get it fixed!   $apache: OK can I get it reset then? He really needs to get in   $Me: I'm sorry but it has to be him who asks to get it reset, I can't do it for anyone else   $apache: But I'm his mother, I can get it reset for him   $me: I'm sorry but it _has to be him_ who comes and gets it reset, it can't be anyone else, even his immediate family   $apache: But I'm his mother, I've done everything for him   $me: I understand that, but college policy states that only the student can request a password reset   $apache: I'M HIS GODAMN MOTHER YOU INCOMPETANT PEICE OF SHIT, GIVE ME HIS GODAMN PASSWORD   At this point I know it's about to get fun, I look back at my manager, who is totally awesome and loves stuff like this, and signal her to get on the line and listen.   $me: I understand your frustration, however I can't go against college policy, I would reccomend that you call your son and tell him to call us to get is password reset.    $apache: NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME YOU LITTLE SHIT, IF YOU DON'T RESET  $hersonandpersonIknow's PASSWORD RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO GET YOU FIRED   Her son was one of the guys who lived on my floor and I knew, but wasn't really friends with.   $me: Ok, let me talk to my manager and see what I can do.  I go back to my manager who is already smiling about this lady, and I tell her I know this guy and if it's alright to text him and let him know that his mom is on the phone asking to chage his password. Since its about his account she says go for it.   $me -> $myfriend: Yo buddy your mom is on the phone cursing me out cause I won't change your password, did you need it reset?   $myfriend: What no. I know my password, why is she calling you?   $me: She's saying you forgot your password and is now going off the walls, I put her on hold and I'm sure she's steaming at this point   $myfriend: Wait, what's her name?   $me: $apache   $myfriend: lol that's not even my mom it's my stepmom.    If you remember from the very beginning this student had selected the ""I dont exist to the outside world"" privacy package, so now we could have even more fun with the attack helicopter parent  _back on the phone_   $me: Hello $apache?   $apache: Yes! What took you so long!!   $me: Sorry I was just looking over some information and I don't see you on our files anywhere being related to any of our students.   $apache: So what! I just want my sons pasword!   $me: I'm sorry, but we have parents of our students on record and youre not on any of them   $apache: $student is my step-son! That's a son!   $me: I'm sorry, we can't release any information at all to anyone that's not an immeditate family member.    $apache: He goes to the school and I'm his mother! Give me his password!   $me: I'm sorry I cannot verify $student's enrollment at our school.   $apache: WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN YOU LITTLE SHIT, I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU FIRED.   At this point my manager is giving me the ""cut the call"" sign so I just tell her:   $me: I'm sorry I couldnt be more help, thank you for calling $school. Have a nice rest of your day   $apache: DON'T HANG UP ON ME YOU LITTLE SH-   click  It was now 5:04, 4 minutes past the end of my shift so I get up and leave.

talesfromtechsupport,"So my story starts on what was a normal day taking calls on the front line for a large cable company.  The job pays well and for the most part the people I deal with are fairly nice to talk to.  Quite often we'll get calls from seniors (especially in the morning) who have premise equipment issues such as ""snow on screen"" or ""no signal"" on their TV sets connected to our digital equipment.   Now my heart does go out to some of these folk because up until recently (past few years) we would supply straight analog cable to many homes (coax direct from wall to TV with scrolling guide).  However most cities we service nowadays require our digital equipment to receive channels, and this has caused a lot of frustration with older people who don't know how to operate said equipment (ie. always having your TV set on ""video"" or ""hdmi"" to get picture).  So often times we get customers who are repeat offenders with long ticket histories of these types of issues.  So anyway, I get a call from an older gentleman who's quite bitter and mean right off the bat (doesn't like that I asked for his address / telephone number to verify the account, hates that he has to speak with a machine before reaching an agent, etc.).  I have some experience handling these types of customers, however this call was going to be a little different.  I spent over 45 minutes with this guy (we'll call him Mr. Smith) trying to get his TV set connected to the digital box properly so he could receive a picture.  No luck.  He was getting clearly frustrated by the whole ordeal and started blaming me for not being able to do my job properly, how I was useless, etc.   Whatever.  Like I said, I've dealt with this before so I tried my best not to take it personally, but eventually I had to ask him if we could book a service tech to the home (a courtesy call) to get his TV working correctly.  Unfortunately, our booking calendar was showing an appointment 3 days out.   That's when he dropped this on me:  ""Don't bother sending a goddamn technician, because I'll be dead by then.  I'm 94 and TV is the only thing I have left, are you really going to make me wait for a tech?""  I instantly felt bad.  I mean, I've heard every complaint in the book as to why people don't want to wait for a tech but this one kind of got to me.  I'm in my mid-20's so honestly I can't even imagine how it must feel to utter those words.  So I spoke with my supervisor, who said they'd see if we could get someone out earlier...but we couldn't promise anything.  So I let Mr. Smith know and he was predictably not very happy with my answer.    At that point it almost sounded like he started to cry and went into how he has no family left, and no friends that come visit (this was after I asked if there was anyone in his building that might be able to help).  Man.  I felt terrible, so I took it upon myself to ask Mr. Smith if I could pay a visit (he lived in a small city over from where I was, not very far to drive).    He was a little shocked I was willing to do this, but sounded thankful I was willing to come out and help him personally.  So I head over, get to the residence and meet him - within 30 seconds I had the cable running again (simple input change) and even brought him a simplified remote for his set top box to avoid this problem in the future.  That's when he started crying.  He goes into how he hasn't actually spoken or really interacted with anyone for years.  He gave me a hug and told me how thankful he was that I came out and helped him, and told me how sorry he was for being so mean earlier on.  I said it was no problem and I was happy to help, and that was it - I left.  3 weeks later, my supervisor comes to my desk and asks me if I could come speak with her for a bit about an account for ""Mr. Smith"".  Turns out, he sent the cable company a letter outlining how thankful he was for helping him with his issue and how it really ""made an old man happy again for once in a very long time"".  The letter was framed and put on our front entrance to retail.  I guess the moral of this story is no matter how nasty someone is to you over the phone, sometimes they're not always a terrible person and just going through a lot.  I still think about Mr. Smith occasionally when I get those nasty customers and it makes me feel a little better.  Anyway thanks for reading just thought I'd share how this one call changed my outlook on life :)  ","['story', 'starts', 'normal', 'day', 'taking', 'calls', 'line', 'large', 'cable', 'company.', ' ', 'job', 'pays', 'people', 'deal', 'fairly', 'nice', 'talk', 'to.', ' ', ""we'll"", 'calls', 'seniors', '(especially', 'morning)', 'premise', 'equipment', 'issues', '""snow', 'screen""', '""no', 'signal""', 'tv', 'sets', 'connected', 'digital', 'equipment.', '  ', 'heart', 'folk', 'recently', '(past', 'years)', 'supply', 'straight', 'analog', 'cable', 'homes', '(coax', 'direct', 'wall', 'tv', 'scrolling', 'guide).', ' ', 'cities', 'service', 'nowadays', 'require', 'digital', 'equipment', 'receive', 'channels,', 'caused', 'lot', 'frustration', 'older', 'people', ""don't"", 'know', 'operate', 'said', 'equipment', '(ie.', 'having', 'tv', 'set', '""video""', '""hdmi""', 'picture).', ' ', 'times', 'customers', 'repeat', 'offenders', 'long', 'ticket', 'histories', 'types', 'issues.', ' ', 'anyway,', 'older', 'gentleman', ""who's"", 'bitter', 'mean', 'right', 'bat', ""(doesn't"", 'like', 'asked', 'address', 'telephone', 'number', 'verify', 'account,', 'hates', 'speak', 'machine', 'reaching', 'agent,', 'etc.).', ' ', 'experience', 'handling', 'types', 'customers,', 'going', 'little', 'different.', ' ', 'spent', '45', 'minutes', 'guy', ""(we'll"", 'mr.', 'smith)', 'trying', 'tv', 'set', 'connected', 'digital', 'box', 'properly', 'receive', 'picture.', ' ', 'luck.', ' ', 'getting', 'clearly', 'frustrated', 'ordeal', 'started', 'blaming', 'able', 'job', 'properly,', 'useless,', 'etc.', '  ', 'whatever.', ' ', 'like', 'said,', ""i've"", 'dealt', 'tried', 'best', 'personally,', 'eventually', 'ask', 'book', 'service', 'tech', 'home', '(a', 'courtesy', 'call)', 'tv', 'working', 'correctly.', ' ', 'unfortunately,', 'booking', 'calendar', 'showing', 'appointment', '3', 'days', 'out.', '  ', ""that's"", 'dropped', 'me:', ' ', '""don\'t', 'bother', 'sending', 'goddamn', 'technician,', ""i'll"", 'dead', 'then.', ' ', ""i'm"", '94', 'tv', 'thing', 'left,', 'going', 'wait', 'tech?""', ' ', 'instantly', 'felt', 'bad.', ' ', 'mean,', ""i've"", 'heard', 'complaint', 'book', 'people', ""don't"", 'want', 'wait', 'tech', 'kind', 'got', 'me.', ' ', ""i'm"", ""mid-20's"", 'honestly', ""can't"", 'imagine', 'feel', 'utter', 'words.', ' ', 'spoke', 'supervisor,', 'said', ""they'd"", 'earlier...but', ""couldn't"", 'promise', 'anything.', ' ', 'let', 'mr.', 'smith', 'know', 'predictably', 'happy', 'answer.', '   ', 'point', 'sounded', 'like', 'started', 'cry', 'went', 'family', 'left,', 'friends', 'come', 'visit', '(this', 'asked', 'building', 'able', 'help).', ' ', 'man.', ' ', 'felt', 'terrible,', 'took', 'ask', 'mr.', 'smith', 'pay', 'visit', '(he', 'lived', 'small', 'city', 'was,', 'far', 'drive).', '   ', 'little', 'shocked', 'willing', 'this,', 'sounded', 'thankful', 'willing', 'come', 'help', 'personally.', ' ', 'head', 'over,', 'residence', 'meet', '30', 'seconds', 'cable', 'running', '(simple', 'input', 'change)', 'brought', 'simplified', 'remote', 'set', 'box', 'avoid', 'problem', 'future.', ' ', ""that's"", 'started', 'crying.', ' ', 'goes', ""hasn't"", 'actually', 'spoken', 'interacted', 'years.', ' ', 'gave', 'hug', 'told', 'thankful', 'came', 'helped', 'him,', 'told', 'sorry', 'mean', 'earlier', 'on.', ' ', 'said', 'problem', 'happy', 'help,', 'left.', ' ', '3', 'weeks', 'later,', 'supervisor', 'comes', 'desk', 'asks', 'come', 'speak', 'bit', 'account', '""mr.', 'smith"".', ' ', 'turns', 'out,', 'sent', 'cable', 'company', 'letter', 'outlining', 'thankful', 'helping', 'issue', '""made', 'old', 'man', 'happy', 'long', 'time"".', ' ', 'letter', 'framed', 'entrance', 'retail.', ' ', 'guess', 'moral', 'story', 'matter', 'nasty', 'phone,', ""they're"", 'terrible', 'person', 'going', 'lot.', ' ', 'think', 'mr.', 'smith', 'occasionally', 'nasty', 'customers', 'makes', 'feel', 'little', 'better.', ' ', 'thanks', 'reading', 'thought', ""i'd"", 'share', 'changed', 'outlook', 'life', ' ']"
talesfromtechsupport,"> $Me  - Hello, IT.   > $Usr - Hi, I am still off sick but I am not.   > $Me  - Oh, did you mean to call HR or is there an IT issue?   > $Usr - It's an IT issue. I am back at work now but I am still sick.   > $Me  - I don't understand the issue.   > $Usr - I have tried to log into $HRsystem but it has me listed as off sick.   > $Me  - Ah, I see, You need to add an end date to your sickness.   > $Usr - But I am back now.   > $Me  - That's ok, you need to fill in the date field with when you came back.   > $Usr - I am back now.   > $Me  - Ok, did you start back at work today?   > $Usr - Yes, I am back now.   > $Me  - Do you have the $HRsystem open in front of you?   > $Usr - Yes.   > $Me  - Can you see the field for 'Date returned to work'?   > $Usr - Yes.   > $Me  - Click the little calendar icon and select the date you returned.   > $Usr - But I am back now.    Are you? Are you really? I am pretty sure you've left your brain cell at home though  > $Me  - So select $TodaysDate from the calendar that pops up.   > $Usr - Why?   > $Me  - So that the $HRsystem knows that you're back at work and not still off sick.   > $Usr - But I am back now.    Are you a rubbish chat bot sent to test me?  > $Me  - You need to tell the HR system when you came back so it unlocks your profile.   > $Usr - Can't it tell?   > $Me  - How would it tell?   > $Usr - Well I am in the building and logged into my computer, is that not enough?    This is a test, has to be a test, am I getting secret shoppered???  > $Me  - The systems aren't linked in that way. People come into work all the time when off on holiday or sick to drop things off/collect things. If the system logged that as a day in work then holiday and sick pay would be all messed up. We also have a number of remote users who are never in the office.   > $Usr - So how do I sort this out?    ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?  > $Me  - Fill in the date field!!!!!  I need to get out of this call!  > $Me  - Can I remote onto your system and help you sort it.   > $Usr - Would you mind. It might be easier.    Too F'in right it'll be easier    > $Me  - Ok, I am on and I'll just add today's date in here and we're all set.   > $Usr - So I am back now?   > $Me  - Yes, you're no-longer being shown as off sick.   > $Usr - Can you reset my password while I've got you on?    Please please please IT gods, don't do this to me    > $Me  - What's wrong with your password?   > $Usr - Nothing, but I got the about to expire message when I logged in and I want to you to reset it for me.   > $Me  - You can change your password yourself by clicking the change password link when you see that screen or wait for it to expire and you'll be forced to do it when you next log in.   > $Usr - I don't want to change my password.    You did this to me...  > $Me  - You have to change your password every 60 days.   > $Usr - Can't you just give me another 60 days?   > $Me  - The policy of changing it is for security.   > $Usr - My password is very secure.    Ok $Usr, I want to play a game...  > $Me  - Ok, what's your current password?   > $Usr - It's $actuallyquitesecurepassword.   > $Me  - Ok, now that you have told me your password it is no longer secure and I must insist you change it immediately.   > $Usr - You work in IT you knew my password anyway!   > $Me  - No, all passwords are secure. I can reset passwords but I can not look at them. As I am still connected to you I will help you change it now.    Proceed to open the password change menu for $User. $User fills in the fields and gets an error saying that new password is a previously used password and thus can't be allowed.    > $Usr - It won't let me change it.   > $Me  - You didn't change it, you just typed it in again?   > $Usr - I don't want to change my password!   > $Me  - You have too. It is company policy.   > $Usr - Passwords are hard to remember.   > $Me  - Just pick a couple of random words and then add a number and a symbol.   > $Usr - what do you mean?   > $Me  - Like DeskMugPhonePencil1! Just pick a few things you can see from your desk and ta da! Easy to remember.  $Usr's new password is 100% going to be DeskMugPhonePencil1!    > $Usr - Ok that's done then.   > $Me  - Ok enter the details on screen then.  New password accepted   Thank F@ck!    > $Me  - That's all sorted for you then.   > $Usr - Great.   > $Me  - I'll disconnect the remote connection.    Freedom    > $Usr - I just thought.    Oh balls    > $Usr - I have been back since last Thursday so will that all be right?   > $Me  - You watched me fill in your return date as today because you said it was today.   > $Usr - I am back today but I came back last week.   > $Me  - Go in $HRsystem and change the return date to last Thursday.   > $Usr - How do I do that?

talesfromtechsupport,"( ( ( Part 4  > To:Boss@company  > From:Steve@client  > Subject: Out of office  > Dear sir:  > I apologize for the inconvenience, but I need to request file XYZ from you. My phone is having trouble recieveing emails, however, but I can receive the file by facebook message.  > Steve  Jack had been out of the office about twenty minutes when Boss forwarded this to me. I called him at his desk. ""Hey Boss. I just got the email you forwarded me. You need me to send file XYZ for you?""  ""Yes. Can you...can you send people files on facebook?""  ""Yes, I can. But I'll have to use the computer Jack's been using, though. It's the only one that can access facebook.""  ""Right, right. I'll meet you in my wife's office.""  I hung up the phone and launched a single .bat file on my desktop. it ran its commands and then deleted itself as I walked away.    I got to Boss' Wife's office a few minutes later. I smiled to her and Boss before crossing to the computer. ""Give me a second to bring up facebook and then--"" I turned the laptop around to face us and Boss's wife reached over, moving the mouse. The screen flared to life.  Boss stared. Boss' Wife gasped. A soft moan, followed by the neigh of a horse, emanated from the laptop. She frantically closed the video window...revealing a second window underneath it; a Bing search for ""best places to buy weed near me"". She closed that one, too...revealing Buzzfeed's ""10 signs you're over your job"".  As she slammed the laptop shut, Boss shook his head, red and shaking with anger. ""How...How was that--I mean, I thought--WHO WAS USING THIS COMPUTER?"" he roared.  Boss's wife shook her head. ""Jack was using it about a half-hour ago..."" As as if on cue, Jack appeared in the doorway with the leftovers from lunch in a carryout bag in his hand.  Boss's back was to him. ""THAT KIND OF THING SHOULD BE BLOCKED!"" He yelled at me, pointing to the laptop.  I nodded. ""I agree. Jack said he needed to use the unrestricted computer for some important projects. That's why he asked you to retrieve the key to my desk last week, right?"" I pointed to the door with my chin and Boss saw Jack.   Jack blinked at Boss. He looked at me. He looked at the computer. Then back to me. I could see it dawned on him what was going on. ""Y-you did something to my computer, didn't you?!"" He demanded.  Of course I had. I had copied a hidden batch file onto Jack's desktop from a USB drive when I ""fixed"" his computer the other day. A file that would send me his browsing history without remoting into his desktop or alerting him. Then, all it would need would be a remote command, which I'd set off from my own computer. The file would then delete itself after launching three web pages as soon as the mouse moved...three of the most incriminating web pages Jack had ever visited on the computer. All it needed was a remote command, which I'd set off from my own computer. Granted, it wasn't entirely untraceable, but the only person who'd know what to look for was in this room, looking with as angry a face I could muster at the awful end user who had become the bane of my existence.  Boss's wife chimed in. She was, at least, slightly more computer-savvy than her husband. ""No. Clickity didn't do anything. He just exited the...you know. The screensaver. Whatever was there must have been what you were...um...working on when you rushed out of the office for lunch."" she glared at Jack and then addressed Boss. ""He must have forgotten to close out the evidence of his blatant misuse of company property.""   I shook my head solemnly. ""And I trusted you with this unrestricted computer, too, Jack. I even gave you your own email address for the company because I thought you'd be an asset. Clearly...clearly I was wrong."" I tried my best to sound hurt.  Boss's Wife nonchalantly picked up the laptop and handed it to me. ""Jack, I am rather upset that you'd do something like this. I hired you as a favor to your mother. And you can be certain she'll hear about this. Now go home.""  Jack stood there, shaking. He probably had an idea of what I had done, but he'd have no way to prove it. ""But...He...I..."" He pointed at me wordlessly.  ""GET OUT!"" Boss yelled.  Jack burst into tears and ran from the room.    Now, as I write this, it's been four weeks since Jack was terminated. I ""patched"" the ""security hole"" from Spotify and the interns are listening to music again. I didn't give the spare desk key back to the office manager.  As for Jack...I saw him the other day when he stopped by with his mother. He came and knocked on my door.  ""Um...Clickity?""  I looked up and narrowed my eyes. ""What.""  ""I just...I wanted to say I'm sorry for...for saying that stuff and...acting like I did...""  I blinked.  ""...and...um...now that I've apologized, I was hoping you could tell my mom that I didn't really look up any of that stuff. You...You know you're the one who did it. Not me. I mean..."" he took a breath. ""I mean, I've learned my lesson...so...""  Seriously?  ""Come on, Clickity. She's made me get another job...and she cut my allowance...COME ON!"" He looked at me pleadingly. I almost felt sorry for him. Almost. Actually, not even almost.  I shook my head and went back to typing. Jack continued standing there, and after a few long moments I looked at him.  ""You can go now.""  And then he was gone.  Edit: Clarity on my evil plan  Edit 2: Wow! 3 gildings on one post.

talesfromtechsupport,"So I had a customer call me up in mobile tech support with the problem that his data wasn't working for 20 minutes, pretty quickly I find out why; he had accidentally turned off his data on the phone menu (which happens a lot but usually the customer goes ""oops silly me""). So this customer starts demanding that he want's compensation for his time without service and being very rude about it. After a couple of minutes he's not taking this is not something we did, but his mistake as a answer, so I get an idea, I tell him I'm going to go speak to my manager.

Well, you guys, my baby is now a toddler, and I just had that misty-eyed, hand-on-heart, proud parent moment that you always hear about. My son was playing with his Brilliant Baby Laptop, which is basically a bright plastic clamshell that plays music when the baby mashes the keyboard. Suddenly, the music stopped. The baby was confused. Further button-mashing had no effect. I watched from the sofa as my son frowned, experimentally smashing the buttons harder. Then, as I looked on in amazement and pride, he turned it off and on again. ""Welcome!"" It announced, the screen lighting up in a joyful display. My son contentedly returned to his button-mashing, and I shed a proud tear. So what if your kid can say ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" and knows how to use a spoon? Mine can troubleshoot!

Now keep in mind he is the kind of person to blame the machinery if he clicks on the wrong thing so I already knew this would not end in a phone call - so I drove to his place expecting to see it still in the box.

Not sure what happened in the week I wasn't there, I ask if he could show me the problem.  He then OPENS CMD AND PINGS HIS OWN CELLPHONE and then points at the 0 packets text to show me there is no connection.  At this point id probably look less surprised if I see an alien invasion.  So after showing him that you need to enter the password to connect to his home wifi, he then asks me how to see his email account again.   Still completely stunned, I show him how to access his outlook account and how to delete some messages.  And the craziest part- when I asked him how did he know about CMD his answer was: ""I learned it from grandma"".  EDIT: I just asked granny about this whole thing and she does not remember.

talesfromtechsupport,"This happened awhile ago. I own my own computer repair business and a customer called me up asking me to build them a computer, they had all the parts and just wanted someone to put it together as they didn't trust them selves. It was a fairly high end computer, they spent probably $2000+ on parts. I put it together with no issues and they were very happy. When they picked it up they asked if I could fix up one of their older computers so their kids could play together. The computer they brought in was maybe 2-3 years old but for the time was top of the line parts and probably cost $2000-$2500, they bought an Nvidia GTX1070 and told me that it needs a hard drive and some extra fans. So I picked up a $100 hard drive, swapped in the 1070, installed the fans and it ran like a dream, I called them and told them it was ready, they were again really pleased and said they would be by later in the day. 3 days later I call them again and ask when they want it and they say they will be on the weekend. 7 days later they say they will be by at the end of the day. 2 weeks later I call and get no answer so I leave a message and send them an email explaining that starting at the beginning of next month there will be a $20/week storage fee since it's been over 30 days since it was completed. I call them in the middle of the week to again confirm when they wanted it and explain the fee, but no answer so I leave a message and text them. The week after I call and no answer so I leave another message, email, and text. On week 3 there was still no answer but they called me back 2 days later explaining there was a family emergency and they were out of town and they would be by within 2 days to pick it up, 3 days go by and they don't show up or call. On week 4 I call one last time and explain that this will be the last message they will get from me and I will hold on to the computer for 90 days at which point I will assume you don't want it and I will take ownership. So we are over day 100 and I now have a very good gaming computer for the low investment of $100.  EDIT: Because a few people are criticizing me of taking advantage of a grieving family, let me clarify; I don't know what the emergency was (for all I know it was some great aunt from Europe), and I have paper work to say it's the companies (mine) after 90 days. Now I pride myself on customer satisfaction so I called them numerous times to try and verbally let them know it was ready and if after a few months they contact me back asking for the computer I will give it back to them.","['happened', 'awhile', 'ago.', 'computer', 'repair', 'business', 'customer', 'called', 'asking', 'build', 'computer,', 'parts', 'wanted', ""didn't"", 'trust', 'selves.', 'fairly', 'high', 'end', 'computer,', 'spent', 'probably', '$2000+', 'parts.', 'issues', 'happy.', 'picked', 'asked', 'fix', 'older', 'computers', 'kids', 'play', 'together.', 'computer', 'brought', 'maybe', '2-3', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'line', 'parts', 'probably', 'cost', '$2000-$2500,', 'bought', 'nvidia', 'gtx1070', 'told', 'needs', 'hard', 'drive', 'extra', 'fans.', 'picked', '$100', 'hard', 'drive,', 'swapped', '1070,', 'installed', 'fans', 'ran', 'like', 'dream,', 'called', 'told', 'ready,', 'pleased', 'said', 'later', 'day.', '3', 'days', 'later', 'ask', 'want', 'weekend.', '7', 'days', 'later', 'end', 'day.', '2', 'weeks', 'later', 'answer', 'leave', 'message', 'send', 'email', 'explaining', 'starting', 'beginning', 'month', '$20/week', 'storage', 'fee', ""it's"", '30', 'days', 'completed.', 'middle', 'week', 'confirm', 'wanted', 'explain', 'fee,', 'answer', 'leave', 'message', 'text', 'them.', 'week', 'answer', 'leave', 'message,', 'email,', 'text.', 'week', '3', 'answer', 'called', '2', 'days', 'later', 'explaining', 'family', 'emergency', 'town', '2', 'days', 'pick', 'up,', '3', 'days', ""don't"", 'call.', 'week', '4', 'time', 'explain', 'message', 'hold', 'computer', '90', 'days', 'point', 'assume', ""don't"", 'want', 'ownership.', 'day', '100', 'good', 'gaming', 'computer', 'low', 'investment', '$100.', ' ', 'edit:', 'people', 'criticizing', 'taking', 'advantage', 'grieving', 'family,', 'let', 'clarify;', ""don't"", 'know', 'emergency', '(for', 'know', 'great', 'aunt', 'europe),', 'paper', 'work', ""it's"", 'companies', '(mine)', '90', 'days.', 'pride', 'customer', 'satisfaction', 'called', 'numerous', 'times', 'try', 'verbally', 'let', 'know', 'ready', 'months', 'contact', 'asking', 'computer', 'them.']"

talesfromtechsupport,"( I shared the story of how I got fired in a huff by someone who, to put it diplomatically, over-estimated his own authority - only for my termination to be rescinded by his manager a few hours later when she found out about it.  This one is the followup; set a year later, and is the story of how I finally ended up quitting that job.   Cast of characters:    Me! I was a lead sysadmin at a very large telco, responsible for the email system at the corporate HQ. I was a contractor there, which will become relevant to the story later.     Jim (J in my last story)- an IT architect at a large telco. Jim was my primary customer contact until he flew off the handle and tried to fire me under circumstances that were dubious at best.  Jim was a pretty smart technical guy who was also a bull in a china shop who shouldn't have been allowed to work around other people.     Lynne (not in the previous story) - Lynne is the IT architect who I was assigned to work with after Jim screwed the pooch in my previous story. She was awesome, for reasons that will become clear soon. She reported to Jim, and utterly loathed him.     Marie (M in the previous story)- Jim's boss, the IT department manager. She unfucked everything after Jim fired me.       In early 2000, I got a phone call at home from an IT recruiter. This wasn't uncommon at all - I had at one point or another interacted with half the sleazy recruitment agencies in my city.   This call was a little bit different.  It was from an in house recruiter for a tech company, a company that was one of the shining stars of tech where I lived, with a reputation for not only having solid technology in their market, but also being a great place to work. They were an honest-to-goodness ""unicorn"" (back before anyone called them that.)  The conversation went something like this:   Recruiter: Hi Blempglorf, this is Recruiter with CoolTechCompany, how are you today?   Me: Doing well, thanks, what can I do for you? Recruiter: Blempglorf, I'm calling because Lynne gave me a copy of your resume, and suggested that I reach out to you about a position we have open.    A bog standard HR introductory call followed, where I found out that they were looking for a lead Windows sysadmin for their internal IT department.   Now this confused the shit out of me, because Lynne was my lead, albeit through a dotted line.  Let that sink in: my boss sent my resume to a recruiter without my knowledge or permission.  Obviously, this was something that warranted further investigation.   So, I called Lynne. Apparently, she had just interviewed at CoolTechCompany, and didn't get the job.  On the ""thanks but no thanks"" call from HR, she told the recruiter something to the effect of ""Well, that's too bad, but I know someone else you need to talk to.  Blempglorf is better at this stuff than me, and I think he'd love working at CoolTechCompany."" And then she sent over my resume, which she had from when she referred me for an internal hire job in another division of the telco we both worked at. When I asked her why she did that she just said: ""You have to trust me on this one. I can't say more.""   So I had a phone interview with the hiring manager at CoolTechCompany. And he and I meshed well, and he decided to bring me in for the full gauntlet interview with the rest of the sysadmin team there.   Around this time, I got a meeting request from Jim, who I hadn't really interacted with a lot since the time he tried (and failed) to shitcan me.  At the meeting, Jim informed me that Telco had decided to insource all the contract sysadmins, and bring them on as direct Telco employees.  He had an offer letter waiting for me at the meeting. I opened the offer letter, only to discover that it was a 20% pay cut from what I was earning as a contractor, to do the same job.  There was a slight bump in terms of benefits value (from what I recall the 401k match was superior) but at first glance, it was obvious that this was a pay hit no matter how you added it up.  Jim also informed me that this wasn't optional, that the insourcing was going to happen whether I liked it or not, and that this was a ""take it or leave it"" offer. Not only would this be a pay cut, but I would also be reporting directly to Jim, as would all the other newly-insourced sysadmins on the team.  Either one of those would be dealbreakers, but I kept my mouth shut, knowing his history.   I caught up with Lynne a few minutes later. She took one look at my face and knew what had just happened. ""This is why I told you to trust me."" she said, before I even said a word.   I could have kissed her.   So, a couple of weeks later I went in for the full interview at CoolTechCompany, which resulted in an offer that would have been a no brainer to accept even if I hadn't just had my pay cut. I received that offer just before the planned effective date of the insourcing (and pay hit.)  The next day, I walked in to Lynne's cube and let her know that I'd gotten the job. She got this look of utter delight on her face, and said to me: ""You HAVE to let me be there when you tell Jim.""  So, we walked over to his office together, and told him.  He looked absolutely floored, and as usually did when he didn't get his way, immediately went into argument mode.   ""All the other sysadmins took the job."" (True, but two others quit within the first two months because they didn't have the headstart on their job search that I did) ""You're making a big mistake""  (And why would that be?) ""Do you think that little company is going to last?""  (They did.)  The problem was that because of the planned insourcing, there was no mechanism to continue to pay me past the end of that week, as Telco's contract with the outsourcer was expiring. Enter Marie. Marie was Jim's boss, who I had a great relationship with. Now, I felt genuinely bad about this, because IT operations at corporate HQ was her responsibility, and this left her with not only no email server support, but only a day to figure out how to ensure continuity. (My backup had quit for unrelated reasons a month before.) I was perfectly willing to give 2 weeks notice per custom, mind you - they just didn't have a straightforward way to pay me for it.   So, Marie called me into her office, after Jim had left for the day. I told her that I was already in the interview process at the time Jim gave me the offer (This was true, although I left out the whole part about Lynne.), and the fact that it was such a big pay cut made it a no-brainer to continue the process. Marie had an utterly stunned look on her face, and she said to me: ""Pay cut?  You all were supposed to be kept at parity.""    What I found out later (through my mole Lynne) was that Jim neglected to relay that instruction to company HR when they were preparing the offer letters.  They prepared the offers at what HR deemed to be market rate, which in this case was a substantial pay hit. I never found out if he did that on purpose, but given that he'd complained in the past that he thought we were overpaid for what we did, I'd be willing to hazard a guess that he did.    Anyway, even though Marie upped the offer to match my current pay rate (so much for take it or leave it) and promised that I'd be reporting to her given my past history with Jim, I still declined as my new job had a lot more long term opportunity.  I ended up taking the job at the telco, just long enough to work out my notice period. HR was VERY confused at my exit interview when they noticed that I'd been with the company for only 9 working days.   Incidentally, I ended up staying at CoolTechCompany for over 8 years. It was the best career move I ever made. My only regret about it was that I was never able to get Lynne a job there.  On the other hand, Marie stepped in and took away all of Jim's supervisory responsibility over the sysadmins, sticking him in a strict technical role.  He lasted a few months after that and bailed out to a much smaller company.

talesfromtechsupport,"I witnessed this astounding IT meltdown around 2004 in a large academic organization.  An employee decided to send a broad solicitation about her need for a local apartment. She happened to discover and use an all-employees@org.edu type of email address that included everyone. And by ""everyone,"" I mean every employee in a 30,000-employee academic institution. Everyone from the CEO on down received this lady's apartment inquiry.  Of course, this kicked off the usual round of ""why am I getting this"" and ""take me offa list"" and ""omg everyone stop replying"" responses... each reply-all'ed to all-employees@org.edu, so 30,000 new messages. Email started to bog down as a half-million messages apparated into mailboxes.  IT Fail #1: Not necessarily making an all-employees@org.edu email address - that's quite reasonable - but granting unrestricted access to it (rather than configuring the mail server to check the sender and generate one ""not the CEO = not authorized"" reply).  That wasn't the real problem. That incident might've simmered down after people stopped responding.  In a 30k organization, lots of people go on vacay, and some of them (let's say 20) remembered to set their email to auto-respond about their absence. And the auto-responders responded to the same recipients - including all-employees@org.edu. So, every ""I don't care about your apartment"" message didn't just generate 30,000 copies of itself... it also generated 30,000  20 = 600,000 new messages. Even the avalanche of apartment messages became drowned out by the volume of ""I'll be gone 'til November"" auto-replies.  That also wasn't the real problem, which, again, might have died down all by itself.  The REAL problem was that the mail servers were quite diligent. The auto-responders didn't just send one ""I'm away"" message: they sent an ""I'm away"" message in response to every incoming message... including the ""I'm away"" messages of the other auto-responders.  The auto-response avalanche converted the entire mail system into an Agent-Smith-like replication factory of away messages, as auto-responders incessantly informed not just every employee, but also each other, about employee status.  The email systems melted down. Everything went offline. A 30k-wide enterprise suddenly had no email, for about 24 hours.  That's not the end of the story.  The IT staff busied themselves with mucking out the mailboxes from these millions of messages and deactivating the auto-responders. They brought the email system back online, and their first order of business was to send out an email explaining the cause of the problem, etc. And they addressed the notification email to all-employees@org.edu.  IT Fail #2: Before they sent their email message, they had disabled most of the auto-responders - but they missed at least one.  More specifically: they missed at least two.

talesfromtechsupport,"First post in quite some time! I work at a local authority on the helldesk. Social workers are the bane of my existence but you learn to cope with their general incompetence as part of the job. But sometimes they can still surprise you. This happened today.  So, we use a generic username for most of our computers so that people can log onto the machine, then from there they log into Citrix to work. Everyone knows the username and password for this. It's literally written on the walls in most areas, because the only thing it can access is another login page, so it isn't a security issue. Most of these accounts stay logged on at all times to save confusing the geniuses that work here. A guy rang up, said hello and asked for the generic login details. I've changed the exact username and password but other than that this is more or less word for word:   >Genius: So what's the username?    >Me: It's 'Computer'.    >Genius: so is that the asset number of the PC?    >Me: Nono, it's just the word 'Computer'    >Genius: And then backslash my name?    >Me: NO. It's the word 'Computer.' C-O-M-P-U-T-E-R. Computer. nothing else.    >Genius: And what's the password?    >Me: It's 'P4ssword'. As in, the word 'Password' with a capital 'P', but you replace the 'a' with a '4'.    >Genius: So it's 'Password4'?    >Me: NO. It is not. It is 'P-4-s-s-w-o-r-d' With a capital P at the beginning. Everything else is lower case.    >Genius: Ok, so the username is ComputerP4ssword. What's the password?    >Me: NO. The username is Computer. The password is 'P4ssword'. That's everything. Just two words. Two boxes, two words.    >Genius: type type type It didn't work.

talesfromtechsupport,"Every office has their special users.  The ones who can't figure out anything technical, everything is an emergency, and everything has to function exactly the same or they can't work.  At my job, it is the HR lady.  Since she is just HR, all her problems boil down to a printer error, excel, word, reboot and it works type of issues, and since I am the System admin they are all my responsibility.    However, every issue she has she comes back to IT, walks right by my desk goes to the programmer, manager, network admin and explains the issue.  Every time they either tell her to go me (even though she gets bitchy), or relay the info to me to fix.    A few weeks back, she had a problem with the calculations on an excel spreadsheet.  Everyone was at lunch, so she's forced to ask me.  Immediately, I say it is probably rounding up or down because it is only off by a penny.  This doesn't suffice, so she ignores me and waits until lunches are done to return.  She goes to programmer guy and like usual, he passes it to me.  I email her with a breakdown showing how it is rounding.  She still wants programmer guy to look at it, so my manager responds with a message saying he will get to when he can.  Well, programmer guy is swamped, the new website launch is getting pushed out, her excel ""problem"" gets shelved with her emails coming ever more frequent.  My manager even resends my explanation, but she wants programmer guy to look at it.  This is unacceptable, so she goes to the VP saying we aren't helping her.    My boss sets up a meeting with the 3 of us for me to explain the issue.  It was the shortest meeting ever because I start explaining it and our VP completely understands right away.  The VP cuts me off, looks at HR lady and says ""You pulled me into a meeting for this shit?""  TLDR; HR lady with easy issue ignores obviously solution only to be burned by VP.

talesfromtechsupport,"So a few years back, I was working in a manufacturing company as IT manager. Like many industries, we had a number of machines with embedded computer systems. For the sake of convenience, we called these ""production machines"", because they produce stuff. By and large, these PC's are just normal desktop PC's that have a bunch of data acquisition cards in them connected to a PLC, or a second network card connected to an ethernet capable PLC. Invariably these PC's are purchased and configured when this production machine is being commissioned, and then just left as is until the production machine is retired... In some cases, this can be as long as 20 years. Please bear in mind that this is 20 years inside a dusty, hot factory environment.   I've been in manufacturing environments before, and this concept is not new to me. Thanks to a number of poignant lessons in the past, I make it my business to understand these PC's inside and out. I like to keep them on a tight refresh cycle, or when it's not practical (in the case of archaic hardware or software), keep as many spares as possible. Also, regular backups are important - you just have to understand that unlike a normal PC, it can be difficult to do and plan it well in advance. More often than not, these PC's aren't IT's responsibility - they fall under engineering or facilities. Even so, these guys understand that IT runs just about every other PC in the business, and welcome any advice or assistance that IT can provide. Finally, these PC's are usually tightly integrated into a production machine, and failure of the PC means the machine stops.   And so we have today's stars:  Airzone: Me, the new IT manager.   TooExpensive: The site's facilities manager. He's in charge of the maintenance of the site, including all of these production machines. He's super paranoid about people trying to take his job, so he guards all his responsibilities jealously and doesn't communicate anything lest they get the drop on his efforts. Oh, and he has a fixation about not spending company money - even to the point of shafting the lawn-mowing guy out of a few hours pay - hence the name.  VPO: Vice president of operations. The factory boss. No nonsense sort of guy.  OldBoy: We'll get to him, but his name is derived from being a man in his 70's.   I'm new, but in my first few weeks I've already had a number of run-ins with TooExpensive. I'm a fairly relaxed guy, but I have no qualms about letting someone dig their own grave and fall into it - and in the case of TooExpensive, I'd be happy to lend him my shovel. My pet hate was when organising new network drops, I will always run a double when we needed a single. We're paying working-at-heights money already, and a double drop is material cost only. i.e. Adding $50 - $100 material on a $4000 single drop cost. He'd invariably countermand all my orders and insist on singles. And then a few weeks / months later, I'd have the sparkie in again to install the second drop, at another $4k.  And then there was the time that he was getting shirty because I was holding up a project of his.. Well sorry, if you are running a project that requires 12 - 16 network ports, you'd better at least talk to the IT guys prior to the day of installation. Not only will you not have drops, you won't have switch ports. And if you didn't budget for them, or advise far enough in advance that I could, then you can wait until I get around to it. Failure to plan is not an emergency.  So you could see that we didn't exactly gel together well.  Which brings us to these production machines, and the PC's nested within. Every attempt for me to try and document, or even understand  them was shut down by TooExpensive.   > Me: Hardware and software specifications?   > TooExpensive: That's my job, get lost.   > Me: Startup and shutdown procedures?   > TooExpensive: That's my job, get lost.   > Me: Backup?   > TooExpensive: That's my job, get lost.  > Me: Emergency contacts?   > TooExpensive: That's my job, get lost.   You get the picture. It resulted in a strong and terse email from TooExpensive to leave it alone. He had all the documentation, contacts, backups, and didn't need, or want my meddling, and I was not to touch any production machine's PC under any circumstance.  Move forward a few months and I'm helping one of the factory workers on their area's shared PC. It's located right next to one of these production machines. It's old. The machine itself was nearly an antique, but the controls system had been ""recently"" upgraded. It had co-ax network of 2 PC's - one NT4 primary domain controller, and a NT4 workstation, and a network PLC (also on co-ax). The machines were pentiums running the minimum specs for NT4 to run, with a control application whose application logic was configured entirely through a propriety database. I had actually seen this software in a different company, so I had some basic familiarity with it. The co-ax was terminated on a hub with a few cat5 ports on it to connect to our LAN and an old hp laserjet printer. These particular production machines are rare, only a few of them exist in the world. We bought this one from a company that had gone out of business a few years earlier.  It was test&tag day and TooExpensive was running around a sparkie to do the testing. My earlier instruction to the sparkie was to not disconnect any computer equipment if it was not powered off. And so it came time to test this production machine's PC. The sparkie wasn't going to touch it while it was on. Luckily TooExpensive came prepared with his thoroughly documented shutdown procedure: yank the power cords. The test passed, new labels were applied to the power cord, he plugged it back in and turned it back on, then ran off to his next conquest without waiting for the boot to finish.  10 minutes later, the machine operator starts grumbling. I have a quick peek, and see that the control software had started, but the screen was garbled and none of the right measurements were showing. TooExpensive is called over, and he talked one look, pales, and then runs off.   10 minutes later, the operator looks at me and asks for help. I call TooExpensive's mobile, and it's off. I called VPO's mobile and suggest that he comes over immediately.  10 minutes later, the operator, VPO, and I are looking at this machine. It's fucked. There's the better part of a million dollars worth of product to be processed by this machine, and the nearest alternate machine is in Singapore, belonging to a different company. And if the processing isn't done within soon, the product will expire and be scrapped. 40% of revenue is from product processed by this machine. We're fucked.  10 minutes later, we still can't get onto TooExpensive. We can't talk to him about the ""backups"" or any emergency contacts that he knows about. We can't even get his phone to ring.  So as I have said, I have used this software before and have a basic understanding. I know enough that the configuration is everything, and configuration is matched to the machine. But I also knew a guy who did some of the implementations. A call to him gave me a lead, and I followed the leads until about 4 calls later, I had the guy who implemented this particular machine. OldBoy had retired 10 years earlier, but VPO had persuaded him to come out of retirement for an eyewatering sum of money.  A few hours later, OldBoy took one look at the machine and confirmed that the database was fucked. We'd need to restore it from backup. TooExpensive is still not contactable.  > Me: Let's assume for a moment that there is no backup. What do we need to do.  > OldBoy: Normally I'd say pray, buy you must have done that already because I haven't kicked the bucket yet.  To cut a long story short, we had to rebuild the database. But not from scratch. OldBoy's MO was when setting up a machine, when he was done, he'd create and store a backup database on the machine. The only issue was that 20 years of machine updates needed to be worked out. It also just so happens that through sheer effort, I am able to compare a corrupted database file to a good one, and fool with it enough to get it to load in the configuration editor. It's still mangled, but we are able to use that as a reference to build the lost config.   All up, it took 4 days to bring this machine back online. But we did. To be honest, I certainly wasn't capable of doing this solo, and without my efforts to patch the corrupted database file, OldBoy would not have been able to restore 20 years of patches that we had no documentation for.  And what of TooExpensive?  After OldBoy and I started working on the problem, he showed up again. He ignored any advice about a backup (because obviously there wasn't any), and instead demanded regular status updates for him to report to VPO. The little shit had screwed up the machine, run off to hide, and now a solution was in progress, was trying to claim the credit.  When it was all running again, OldBoy debriefed VPO on the solution. I then had my turn with VPO.  > VPO: So Airzone. Thanks for your help. Your efforts have un-fucked us.   > Me: No worries.  > VPO: And now we get to the unpleasant bit. TooExpensive claims that you didn't follow procedure when shutting down the machine, causing it to crash. He also claims that you hadn't taken any backups, and it was effectively your fault.  > Me: And when we tried to call him?  > VPO: He claims he was busy contacting his emergency contacts.  > Me: I see.  > VPO: I don't believe a word of that shit. Unfortunately it's your word vs his. If I had the evidence, I'd fire him.  > Me: (opening the email TooExpensive had sent me about meddling on my phone) You mean this evidence?   Half an hour later, I got the call to lock TooExpensive's account and disabled his access card.   Edit: Wow, this story seems to have resonated with so many people here..

talesfromtechsupport,"This actually happened a couple of weeks ago. As context (for those who haven't read my posts before) - I work an out of hours IT desk, we support multiple businesses after hours when their IT teams leave for the day.  It's 11:30 pm and I get a call through from my least favourite business we support (we have no systems access and very little in the way of documentation, their calls are renowned for being a pain in the ass to deal with).  EA = Extremely affluent sounding British guy  Me: Service desk how can I help?  EA: Oh hello I'm not able to print  Me: Okay, any error messages? Any signs of life from the printer?  EA: Now hold on I'm not a computer person so you'll need to use simple terms  Me: What happens when you print?  EA: Nothing happens that's why I'm calling you!  Me: Do you see any messages appear on the screen when trying to print?  EA: No  I have a particularly low tolerance for these kinds of callers who are unable to provide even basic details. This guy was also coming across as very condescending  Me: Is your printer turned on? Can you see any lights?  EA: Of course!  Me: Can you walk me through what you generally do to print something?  EA: I'm not a computer person so you'll need to be more clear  Me: Tell me how you'd usually print  EA: Look here, I don't really understand what you're asking me  Me: What would you usually do to print?  EA: I don't understand you  Me: Ok sir, I'd like to connect remotely to your computer so I can see what's on the screen. Is that okay?  EA: This is all very complicated. I'm not sure what you want to do.  Me: I'd like to access your computer so I can see what's wrong  EA: I'm sorry, can you explain that more clearly?  Me: I'm not sure how much clearer I can actually be with this. I need to remotely connect to try and fix this for you  EA: Look this is terribly unfriendly for people who aren't technically savvy like myself. Why can't you fix this?  Me: I'm trying to help you and fix it but you haven't been able to provide a great amount of detail on the issue, so I'd like to remotely connect a take a look myself  EA: I'm not familiar with these technical terms. This is very hard. I don't understand why we have you people if you can't help people who aren't technically savvy  Me: I'm trying to help, however as it's out of hours our scope is limited. I need to remotely connect to see what's going on. I respect that you are not technically savvy but at the same time we do expect a certain level of existing knowledge from users in order to be able to provide our support service after hours. I can ask that the main service desk calls you back in the morning if you'd prefer?   EA: No look this is very important and I need this fixed, how do you get on my screen?  Me: Firstly, I need you to open a web browser or just go to Google  EA: I JUST USE THIS FOR EMAIL WHAT ON EARTH IS A WEB BROWSER?  Me: Do you use Google?  EA: Yes of course I do!  Me: Okay, please go to Google....  we spend a painful amount of time getting gotoassist working  Me: Thank you I'm now connected. I'm going to take a look at the printer setup now  Me: I see the printer is reporting ""not connected"". Can you check to make sure it's plugged in please?  I Google the model number and this is an old-ass Epson printer. USB only. At this point I've had enough of this callers ineptness  EA: But I don't know HOW!  Me: I'm sorry, I really can't help you with this part. You're the one physically located with the computer and the printer. Go to the printer and make sure any wires coming from it are plugged into the PC.  EA: OK.   Several minutes later I hear the unmistakable sound of a device being connected in Windows  Me: Okay, the printer is now showing as connected so it looks like the plug was disconnected. Please try printing again.  EA navigates to Outlook, opens an email about discounted camping products and proceeds to print it off  Me: I can hear the printer in the background so it looks like we're good now?

techsupport,"Figured I should write this stuff down before I forget it all, and where better for TaskManager than r/techsupport!  If there's any appetite for this, I'll expand on it!   I don't blog, so here goes...  Some Task Manager lore: I'm the Microsoft (Redmond, '93) developer that wrote TaskMgr at home in my den in about 1994 and then the NT silverback devs let me check it into the main tree even though I was a greenhorn at the time.  So that meant I got to bring it into work and polish it up and make it an official part of Windows, where it remains to this day.  So I got to define my own day job, actually, which was nice!  I don't know if it's still like that, but great culture and people.  This is all based on XP, as I left long ago, but it's still the same core app underneath.  In no particular order:  \- If Task Manager ever hangs or crashes, start another by pressing ctrl-shift-esc.  Winlogon will look for an existing instance and try to revive it for up to 10 seconds.  If the old Taskmgr doesn't start making sense by responding with a secret code within that time, another one will be launched.  That way, you're never without a Taskmgr as long as there are some resources available.  \- Task Manager will load in reduced mode if resources are short, like only loading the Processes page if that's what's needed to get going.  It's one of the very few apps that won't just ""fail and bail"" when things go wrong.  \- If Task Manager ever becomes internally corrupted, kill/close it.  Restart it while holding down CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT, and Task Manager will reset ALL internal settings to factory fresh if it sees that key combo at startup.  Same works for every app I've written, btw, I think!  \- If all your titlebars disappear and you just have a graph, double-click dead client space to switch back to normal mode.  This no-titlebar mode is a mode I added to follow the NT clock, where you could remove borders as well, but it confused more people than it ever helped I'm sure!  \- I initially drew the meters as 7-segment LEDs but that wasn't localizable to all cultures (How do you do a right-to-left reading 7-segment LED for Saudi Arabia?) so they only lasted for one version or so.  \- CTRL-SHIFT-ESC will launch Taskmgr without any help from the Shell, so if the Shell/Explorer is dead use this key combo to bring up TM and then reset/restart the shell.  Even if your tray is missing and gone, this combo should start it.  \- If the shell can't start something or is hung, try Task Manager.  It has a mode where it will load without ANY references to the shell32.dll and allow you to start programs like CMD.EXE without the start menu.  \- You can find the binary for any executing process in the process table by right clicking and pick ""Show File Location"".  You can also search it online, but I don't know if they have useful info for much.  \- There should be nothing that TaskMgr can't kill - it will even escalate privilege and (if you have it) enable debug privilege to attach to and kill apps that way if needed.  If TM can't kill it, you've got a kernel problem.  \- A lot of people don't seem to know you can add many additional columns, remove others, drag them around to reorder, etc.  \- The reason there's a Window class called ""DavesFrameWndProc"" is because to get flicker-free resizing I needed group boxes to not try to paint on one another, so subclass them, give them their own wndproc, and enabling WS\_CLIPSIBLINGS during WM\_CREATE.  At least I think so!  \- TM is one of the apps I'm most proud of because it is probably the first or at least most visually complicated app to ever be fully resizable in all dimensions without any flicker up till then.  I was hardcore about memory and flicker in my day, so it was under 100K for the exe and never flashed or crashed, that was my thing!  Having the GDI32 and User32 guys down the hall sure helped.  I also wrote/ported Space Cadet pinball, zip folders, worked on start menu, shell, calc, ole32, product activation, and some other stuff.  I was in MS-DOS before that but I doubt anyone is still supporting MS-DOS!     Edit:  Looks like comments have been locked, so I'll update this one time with some answers to the most interesting/common questions below!     \- On the command line, I'm stumped, as I don't remember command line args to it at all!  \- On Space Cadet, yes, you can run it on Windows 10, but I doubt it's official or legal, so will point you at your favorite search engine for that one, but it's easy.  And on Space Cadet, reminder that Maxis did the very original (M. Ridgeway) and mine was just a rewrite in 32-bit portable C using their art.  That way it ran on the PowerPC, Alpha, and MIPS as well.  And yes, in the original there is a ""God Mode"" where you can drag the ball around, click on targets, etc.  Search is your friend there as well.  \- On what I'm doing these days, I volunteer to teach kids to program at school, or used to until recently, so now I'm mostly coding and working on my coding channel, which you can follow here: [ and I also restore old musclecars, pickups, etc.  So yes, I still code every day!  \- On the notion that there are some things that Taskmgr can't kill, there were post-XP for sure but they were intentional limits.  I remember something about journalists making news by using TM to kill the root winlogon session, for example, which would bugcheck the machine intentionally.  But the fact you could bluescreen NT didn't look good, I suspect, so they likely started to protect people from themselves by disallowing killing win32k.sys and other essential components.    \- Thanks to the mods for being flexible on this one!

techsupport,"I have been at it 6 hours trying to do it myself.  My lawyer has a guy that does it for $2,500 - but that is way out of my wheelhouse.  I'd pay for help if the video was recovered, but I'm not the kind of guy with more than $500 to ""play"" with.  I know your time is valuable, so let me know what you need to do it.  I will answer any questions you have up-front and with pure honesty.  EDIT:  Anybody in the Houston area I will come to personally. EDIT 2:  All good advice got gold, I left a comment asking for PayPal info to compensate the best of the thread.  Thank you.  Please send me your PayPal info.  EDIT 3:  Got up to take a piss at 2:30am, and holy shit.  Let me clarify a few things.  1) I was not belligerent - not until I had the knee in my face - then it was mostly ""what the fuck.""  2) I don't care to waste my time suing anyone who doesn't deserve it.  Karma in real life might actually be a real thing.  3)  I don't need to beat a DUI.  They took the blood without an arrest and without a warrant.  In Texas, that gets suppressed with a quickness.  4)If I was acting like a belligerent asshole,  show me one cop that wouldn't take me in right then.  5) Regardless of all that other BS and the court of Reddit administering a verdict, I still really, really need this video.  EDIT 4:  2 things - 1... I am working through all of your suggestions (making a list now, setting up in the morning). PHONE IS OFF.  I had 20GB of free space on the internal.  No SD, no Cloud, No Hamster.  2....  I know as much as the next guy how people can be on the internet.  That's not me.  Know why?  Because I'm trying to get the video back, that's why.  What the fuck would I want of a video of me deservedly getting attacked after treating a medical team like shit?  ""I'm Rob Lowe and this is Dickhead Asshat Doctor Provoking Rob Lowe with cable?""  EDIT 5 (Tuesday): No rooting programs are working.  I copied every folder from my phone to my computer.  It turns out that Verizon's SM-N910V has something called a bootblocker or some shit like that.  So I am on to manually try this out.  EDIT 6 (Tuesday Afternoon):  There is no way to root this phone without dealing with a bootloader or something that every forum says we have to wait for.  I contacted a Data Forensics company in Austin that might be able to do something, but if I have to go that route I am going to have to wait until I get paid on the 15th.  They are going to call me back sometime today to let me know if they can even do anything.  Meanwhile, any suggestions that require the phone to be rooted are no good.  I can't thank y'all enough, though.  I'll deliver something as soon as I figure out what I need to do next.  EDIT 7 (Tuesday still):  I have a call with the guy from Austin at 2pm or so Central - I'll let y'all know what he thinks.  EDIT 8 (Tues.):  They are going to email me some detailed info regarding what they do to get the video.  Obviously, I probably won't understand one fucking detail, but I'll post it here.  For now, you guys stay awesome.  I need to get some work done.  EDIT 9:  YOU GUYS ARE ABOVE-AVERAGE!!!!  A company in Oklahoma just offered to forensically recover the video for me as pro-bono, pro-civil right, just plain badass way to help me out.  Once again, no matter what....  I will post the video as soon as I can, no matter how it makes me look.   I am Fed-Exing the phone there this afternoon.  EDIT 10:  Continuing my policy of ""surely delivering"" I give you a copy of the (  EDIT 11:  Not much new today to report except that my phone arrived at the Data Forensics facility.  FedEx Tracking 807519987715  EDIT 12:  Wednesday activities:  Phone will be dumped by Thursday morning when recovery work will commence.  EDIT 13:  Got an email this morning (Thursday) saying they are recovering the data today.  That does not mean shit to the great reveal.  I made the mistake of scrolling too low in some of the other threads this ended up on, and I am not having my integrity questioned anymore - at least where I can do something about it.  ( from the night of the incident showing that I went HOME and did not, as some claim, have a DWI that I am just covering up for.  Check the address, it is the hospital - not the jail.  EDIT 14:  I had another update from the guys in OKC with my phone.  They were able to pull a lot of old contacts, messages, etc. from my phone, but no video.  They want to use a new code they have for this new phone (Verizon Note 4) to see what they can get.  They estimate a Tuesday completion.  That does not mean I am going to upload the video if I get it right away.  My attorney and ABC-13 in Houston are going to make sure that anything I upload does not violate HIPPA laws.  I am here for any other questions anyone has, but you have to be as patient as I am before I upload the video.  I spoke with my attorney today and he is being very cautious about how we go about this.  I got a copy of my medical records from that night which are full of contradictory statements.  You all can expect no updates over the weekend.  Not because I am being deceptive, but mostly because my attorney has a newborn, I need to catch up with my job, and the guys in OKC don't work over the weekend.  This is going to be a process, and as much as I want to deliver ASAP, the data is going to be delivered and the story develops --- and that shit takes time.  I am always available to answer questions if you message me.  EDIT 15 (Monday Night):  Nothing new to report.  Last Friday I was told that there would be either a yes or no on recovery by close of business on Tuesday.  I'm not rushing anybody, so I didn't ask for an update today.  I probably will tomorrow.  I see all of the ""RemindMe"" things, and I want you all to know that it is still in the works.  The sheer amount of professionalism going into this is going to be a valuable addition to the people on this sub that I intended to interact with before this blew up.  I think we are all going to be in a position to learn ""real(ish) time"" how they are handling this.  I don't know dick-one about what is going on technically with my phone, but I'm sure we'll get some insight soon.  EDIT 16 (Tuesday Night):  There is still nothing new to report.    EDIT 17 (Wednesday Afternoon):  The email from the data forensics company:  >Hello again Reddit friend, > >Long story short, you are boned. Our forensic devices were able to semi-dump this phone, but the video you are looking for was not in the dumps. > >So here is the long story. The Verizon Note 4 is bootloader locked with no known exploit. It has several security systems in place to make sure you (the owner) don't get to do anything with the phone that Samsung and VZW dont approve of, UNLESS you buy the Verizon Note 4 'Developer Edition'. The reason that this matters to you, is that there is no way currently to access a full bit-for-bit copy of the internal storage.  >Our resident Android Guru has been working on this solid since we got your phone (partly because of the almost $15000 reward for it), but is up against a wall as well. > >In effect, you are out of luck on recovering the video until an exploit is found for this phone (which it may or may not ever be). Your options are to keep the phone safe and unused somewhere until the phones security is broken, or to move on. > >I wish we had better news, and I wish that Android phone manufacturers would keep these open source phones open, and not locked like Fort Knox (  >Please get me your shipping address and we will overnight the phone back to you. I am sorry, and I know this is not what you were hoping for, us either!  They also included a spreadsheet breaking down the bounty for unlocking the phone.  Either way, this is good information for this sub, I'd assume, and bad for the people with the pictchforks and such.  My attorney is still moving forward, and that is going to be a long process, so if your ""RemindMe"" shit doesn't have ""months"" somewhere in it, you can forget that.  Seriously, the internet is awesome when you look at it from the standpoint of I cane to this sub to get a result and I got one (good or bad).  It sucks when apparently I became a ""Karma Whore"" somewhere in here.  You all can think what you want, but seriously, how does this matter to your life?  Stop being so cynical.  In the words of (  EDIT 18 (Feb 16):  Some of y'all need to get a life.  I'm not some cop-bashing anti-anything attention seeker.  I came here for a tech support issue and got exactly that.  If the result isn't what you had hoped for, too goddamned bad, go upstairs and cry to your mom.  The people who help out in here are awesome, and shouldn't have to deal with some of you terrible, terrible human beings who for whatever reason think that the reading and commenting on a story makes them somehow entitled to anything. Nobody owes you shit, get used to it.    Final Outcome (November):  The company from Oklahoma tried to get the video out of the phone for no charge and could not get it. I knew that the hospital had cameras and I tried to get a lawyer where I am to take the case on a contingency fee basis which was unsuccessful. Not an exciting conclusion to the story, but it is what it is.  Thank you all, I hope you all have a happy holiday season.  Super Three-Year-Later Edit: This pissed me off so much, I went to law school and became an attorney and now do defense work in Texas.   Super Duper Edit - This turned into a radio episode, and yes, apparently you can edit this shit in perpetuity.

Please make a post instead. Your files are at stake.  &#x200B;  Tip: Windows 7 and below is no longer supported by Microsoft and UNSAFE to use. If you are still running Windows 7 with a LEGIT license, you can obtain a free upgrade to Windows 10 by using the ( from Microsoft. They have been very generous in continuing to allow users to upgrade from Windows 7 at no charge. Do this upgrade AFTER your system has been cleaned of malware. A system image backup is highly recommended before starting this process. This backup can be performed to an external hard drive with the ( located in the Control Panel on Windows 7 and up.     Purpose & Scope of this Guide:  This guide is designed to assist you in removing malware from an infected system that successfully boots. If your computer is completely unable to boot due to malware, please make a post, as this guide will not help you. If you perform the following steps exactly as described, this will solve your problem in over 90% of scenarios. That said, not all malware is created equal, and not all malware removal tools are created equal. The tools recommended in this guide were picked because of their high success and low failure rates, measured on a very large scale. However, there will be times that this guide fails in removing malware. If that is the case, please make a post for further assistance, stating that this guide was unsuccessful. It is recommended to only accept advice from a “Trusted” technician. I am writing this guide in layman’s terms so that most people will be able to understand it with ease.     Disclaimer:  The following instructions are recommendations only. You take full responsibility for any steps you choose to perform on your computer. While the following recommendations are performed without issue on countless machines, there is always a risk of damaging your Operating System or experiencing data loss on any machine. It is solely YOUR responsibility to save all work and back up any and all important data on your system before proceeding.      Malware Remediation Steps:  Before proceeding, go into your browser’s extensions and remove all suspicious items. Also go into your browser’s settings and remove any default search providers and unusual homepages. If you are unsure how to do this, proceed to Step 1.     Download and run the following tools in this order. Run all tools unless otherwise instructed. All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or the scans fail in Normal Mode. All tools must be run under an Administrator account. Do not remove any tool-generated logs in the event a helper needs you to post them to further assist you.     1) Run ( Sometimes it takes a few minutes to finish. Do not reboot when done.

Then, run a “(”   Successfully removes the vast majority of infections  Has an industry-leading, lightning fast scanning  & heuristics engine  Has built-in repair tools to fix damage done by malware     3) Run ( using the “(” button.

HitmanPro is a phenomenal ""second-opinion"" malware scanner. I recommend clicking ""Settings"" and uncheck ""Scan for tracking cookies"" before starting the scan. This will drastically reduce scan times. This tool can only be run ONCE for free. Use it wisely.     Please note: If malware has prohibited you from browsing the web or downloading files, you can try running the (  with ( which will attempt to restore your internet connection & default browser settings. You may have to download these tools on another computer and move them to a flash drive that you can plug into the infected machine.     Think your Mac is infected?  Try ( Please make a post if it is unsuccessful.     If you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in /r/techsupport for further assistance.     Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):   Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts.  Consider enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts!  Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.     What is malware?  ( is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. \     How did I get infected?  It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher’s website directly.     How to prevent future infections:  Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using ( for installing/updating software is very easy & safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.     The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:     Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:   ( (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)  (  (  Free AVs will only go so far. I highly recommend purchasing the AV of your choice to get better protection. Companies who offer products for free are usually making money off you one way or another. This has been ( If you use Avast, uninstall it immediately.

techsupport,"Windows 7 support has ended, on ( Basically what this means is that if you're still using it, you should probably stop using it, or patch it with ESU, or do something else to stay protected.  In this post we'll be going over some of the options you have, including:   Upgrade to Windows 10.  Switch to a Linux distro such as Ubuntu.  Switch to a Mac, if you don't like the above.  Modify your system to allow ESU patches.  Unplug your Windows 7 computer from the Internet.  Keep using your Windows 7 computer as-is and risk malware.  Stop using desktop computers entirely.  We'll also go over some ways to stay secure, regardless of which of the above you choose.  LinusTechTips also has a great video on this topic, you may wish to check it out:   # Upgrade to Windows 10  For many people reading this post, this is your best option.  Upgrading to Windows 10 is the only option that guarantees you can keep using all of the latest software and playing all of the latest Windows games. Many newer games, especially VR games, only support Windows 10 (and not Windows 7 or 8.1).  There is still some choices you can make of which version and edition of Windows you want. Windows 10 has various editions, including Home, Pro, Education, and Enterprise. Enterprise gives you the most control over your system, while Home gives you the least control over it, and Pro is somewhere in-between. Enterprise is not typically available to consumers, you have to go through a business. Education has the same feature set as Enterprise, but it is licensed for schools.  If you are in school, you should see if you are eligible for a license for Windows 10 Education. If not, see if you have a way to obtain a Windows 10 Enterprise license. If not, you can very likely ( If none of those options work for you, and you need to pay for a new license, the Pro version is preferable to the Home version.  Aside from installing and activating manually, you could also just buy a new computer that comes with Windows 10.  The main downside to upgrading to Windows 10 is that it gives you less control over your system, with features such as auto-installing apps (not a problem on Enterprise and Education editions), forced updates, Cortana, and vastly more ""telemetry"" services. Even if you hate spying, Windows 10 still may be your best option simply due to the advantage of running all the latest AAA games.  Microsoft provides an official way to download Windows 10 here:   If you need help installing a newer version of Windows, check out this guide:   # Switch to a Linux distro such as Ubuntu  These days, Linux distros are truly a great alternative to Windows. Linux is very stable and secure, and does everything an average user wants, whether that be Facebook or writing essays. If you are a gamer, Linux has thousands of native games and many more are available via Proton, you can play the majority of games on Steam on Linux with no hassle.  If you play games with heavy DRM or anti-cheat, or play VR games, or frequently use Adobe products, Linux may not be a good option for you. But even if you do play those games or use those products, you also have the option of dual-booting, so that you can have both Windows and Linux installed at the same time. This post doesn't go too much into detail on Linux, since the below links are already great resources.  Most importantly, Linux is 100% free, so you can give it a try without any risks, and switch back to Windows whenever you wish.  For more information about switching to Linux, see this post on the Linux gaming subreddit:   When you are ready to install Linux, check out this guide:   If you'd like a more concrete guide, this PDF focuses specifically on setting up Ubuntu for gaming, including setting up drivers, Steam, and more, with a focus on dual-booting:   # Switch to a Mac  This is the only option that requires you to buy new hardware, since MacOS only runs on Macs, and will not run on a non-Mac PC. Macs are great systems overall, they are very secure and are a favorite option of many developers and businesses.  The downsides of Mac are that it is expensive, and if you are a gamer, that it runs vastly fewer games. These days, Mac is a worse choice for gaming than Linux is.  # Modify your system to allow ESU patches  Microsoft is selling ( for Windows 7 users who can't upgrade for whatever reason. This is aimed at businesses, but you can still get ESU for Windows 7 Professional edition. ( is $50 for the first year, $100 for the second year, and $200 for the third year. If you can't afford this, there may be unofficial methods to obtain these updates.  # Disconnect your Windows 7 computer from the Internet  This is a fairly simple option that doesn't need too much explanation. If you unplug your computer from the Internet, you can't get viruses from the Internet. As long as you don't pass around infected USB flash drives, then you are pretty much immune from viruses if you aren't connected to the Internet. Of course, for many people, this makes your computer unusable.  # Keep using your Windows 7 computer as-is and risk malware  This is a terrible option, since it's very insecure to do this. This option maybe isn't too bad if you don't have any sensitive data whatsoever on your machine, and it's an option worth mentioning, but this option is not recommended.  # Stop using desktop computers entirely  If you don't like newer versions of Windows, or Linux distros, or Mac, you need to be on the Internet, and you don't want to be insecure, then the only\ option left is to stop using desktop computers entirely. For a lot of people, this is an unacceptable option, but many people can get away with living in the modern world only using phones and tablets, so it's worth mentioning.  Also, Chromebooks are great if you don't need to do anything on your computer except for browsing the web.  # How to stay secure on any system  No matter what you choose, there are plenty of ways to stay secure online.  Blocking ads helps a ton due to malvertizing. The browser extension uBlock Origin (( ( ( does a great job at blocking ads. Additionally, it's a great idea to get a ( or a ( to block ads before they even get to your system in the first place.  The browser extension HTTPS Everywhere (( ( ( will automatically redirect you to the secure version of a website, if there is one. This is a simple and easy way to improve your security while browsing the web.  If you are running Windows of any kind, getting an anti-virus is generally a good idea. One of the most commonly recommended ones is ( A really nice feature of Malwarebytes is that it can run alongside other anti-virus software, so you can use Malwarebytes regardless of if you already have an anti-virus.  Don't forget that these can also be installed on smartphones, not just your desktop PC!  # Conclusion  You should do something to stay secure. Whether you switch to a newer version of Windows, switch to a Linux distro such as Ubuntu, switch to a Mac, unplug your computer from the Internet, or throw it away, they all result in you staying more secure than if you continue to use your computer as-is. And once you've decided what system you're going to use, there are many ways to make it more secure.

techsupport,"I woke up last Sunday morning to find out my Google login was suspended at 1-something in the morning. I figured it was hacked somehow (despite the fact I use two-factor authentication) or my phone had a virus and had been spamming, etc. I followed the prompts to file an appeal and was directed to a single text box where I needed to justify why the account should be reinstated.  I'm a long-term customer and have never been warned or suspended for anything. I was surprised to see they didn't have the professional courtesy to tell me why it was suspended or to provide a warning if they observed anything that would even lead to a suspension.  After talking to someone at Google Fi and then Google Play I was advised that the only thing I could do was submit a response via the form and there was nothing they could do.  I replied on the web form and then left for the week on business travel.  Let me take a break with the story to tell you about some of the Google products I rely on:  -Fi (signed up when it was still a beta service, just updated to a Pixel 4 XL) -Nest (awesome that now requires a Google account) -Gmail (used for all of my personal correspondence) -Drive -Chrome -Others  I received a response THREE DAYS LATER that the account would not be reinstated and had violated the Terms of Service with no further explanation and a link to them for my review. The fact that my home security, text messaging, email, and storage were already out for a few days while I was away from my family was bad enough, but I was absolutely stunned to receive this kind of treatment by a company of this magnitude. I replied again, asking for some justification or steps I could follow to get the account reinstated and have not received a response. That was four days ago. I attempted to port my number to another provider on Friday to get my text messaging reinstated, but get this--the folks at Google Fi can't give you your account info if you can't authenticate with their app which is connected to your Google account!  It's been over a week since the account was suspended and I have made no progress. Has anyone out there made it through the bureaucracy and gotten their account reinstated? Any other ideas?","['woke', 'sunday', 'morning', 'find', 'google', 'login', 'suspended', '1-something', 'morning.', 'figured', 'hacked', '(despite', 'fact', 'use', 'two-factor', 'authentication)', 'phone', 'virus', 'spamming,', 'etc.', 'followed', 'prompts', 'file', 'appeal', 'directed', 'single', 'text', 'box', 'needed', 'justify', 'account', 'reinstated.', ' ', ""i'm"", 'long-term', 'customer', 'warned', 'suspended', 'anything.', 'surprised', ""didn't"", 'professional', 'courtesy', 'tell', 'suspended', 'provide', 'warning', 'observed', 'lead', 'suspension.', ' ', 'talking', 'google', 'fi', 'google', 'play', 'advised', 'thing', 'submit', 'response', 'form', 'do.', ' ', 'replied', 'web', 'form', 'left', 'week', 'business', 'travel.', ' ', 'let', 'break', 'story', 'tell', 'google', 'products', 'rely', 'on:', ' ', '-fi', '(signed', 'beta', 'service,', 'updated', 'pixel', '4', 'xl)', '-nest', '(awesome', 'requires', 'google', 'account)', '-gmail', '(used', 'personal', 'correspondence)', '-drive', '-chrome', '-others', ' ', 'received', 'response', 'days', 'later', 'account', 'reinstated', 'violated', 'terms', 'service', 'explanation', 'link', 'review.', 'fact', 'home', 'security,', 'text', 'messaging,', 'email,', 'storage', 'days', 'away', 'family', 'bad', 'enough,', 'absolutely', 'stunned', 'receive', 'kind', 'treatment', 'company', 'magnitude.', 'replied', 'again,', 'asking', 'justification', 'steps', 'follow', 'account', 'reinstated', 'received', 'response.', 'days', 'ago.', 'attempted', 'port', 'number', 'provider', 'friday', 'text', 'messaging', 'reinstated,', 'this--the', 'folks', 'google', 'fi', ""can't"", 'account', 'info', ""can't"", 'authenticate', 'app', 'connected', 'google', 'account!', ' ', ""it's"", 'week', 'account', 'suspended', 'progress.', 'bureaucracy', 'gotten', 'account', 'reinstated?', 'ideas?']"
techsupport,"Recently got Pornhub Premium which allows you to watch and download premium videos in 1440p and 4k. Downloaded a few and they're all over 1GB 4k VR .mp4 files. When playing them on my PC I can hear sound, but only see a blank screen with a distorted green line on the top and sometimes the entire screen turns green. Also the player starts freezing. Tried with both VLC and MPC-HC. It's like I'm downloading corrupted videos.   I actually intended to use them on the Mobile VR Station app for use in a mobile VR headset, but they won't play there either showing a ""Cannot decode"" error.   I hope someone can help me in this emergency!  &nbsp;  P.S. I tried playing some VR videos I've downloaded in the past both from Pornhub AND other sources and they all work fine.  P.P.S. on Windows 10 64bit.  #EDIT:  Ok, it looks like it's only the Mobile VR Station app on iOS that can't play the videos. They play perfectly fine on Windows using Windows's default video player and in VLC after disabling Hardware Encoding. Now I just need to find a better mobile app that can play these videos.  #EDIT 2:  I tried SKYBOX VR Video Player for iOS. Seems like a much better VR player, and it can actually play the videos, but sadly with a black screen and only audio.","['recently', 'got', 'pornhub', 'premium', 'allows', 'watch', 'download', 'premium', 'videos', '1440p', '4k.', 'downloaded', ""they're"", '1gb', '4k', 'vr', '.mp4', 'files.', 'playing', 'pc', 'hear', 'sound,', 'blank', 'screen', 'distorted', 'green', 'line', 'entire', 'screen', 'turns', 'green.', 'player', 'starts', 'freezing.', 'tried', 'vlc', 'mpc-hc.', ""it's"", 'like', ""i'm"", 'downloading', 'corrupted', 'videos.', '  ', 'actually', 'intended', 'use', 'mobile', 'vr', 'station', 'app', 'use', 'mobile', 'vr', 'headset,', ""won't"", 'play', 'showing', '""cannot', 'decode""', 'error.', '  ', 'hope', 'help', 'emergency!', ' ', '&nbsp;', ' ', 'p.s.', 'tried', 'playing', 'vr', 'videos', ""i've"", 'downloaded', 'past', 'pornhub', 'sources', 'work', 'fine.', ' ', 'p.p.s.', 'windows', '10', '64bit.', ' ', '#edit:', ' ', 'ok,', 'looks', 'like', ""it's"", 'mobile', 'vr', 'station', 'app', 'ios', ""can't"", 'play', 'videos.', 'play', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'windows', ""windows's"", 'default', 'video', 'player', 'vlc', 'disabling', 'hardware', 'encoding.', 'need', 'find', 'better', 'mobile', 'app', 'play', 'videos.', ' ', '#edit', '2:', ' ', 'tried', 'skybox', 'vr', 'video', 'player', 'ios.', 'like', 'better', 'vr', 'player,', 'actually', 'play', 'videos,', 'sadly', 'black', 'screen', 'audio.']"
techsupport,"I am using a Mod Mic Uni as my microphone and for my headphones I have the hd58x. Both are connected to the Schiit Fulla 3 amp/dac.
