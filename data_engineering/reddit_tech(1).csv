talesfromtechsupport,"I was thrust a laptop by an angry exec early this morning with him complaining that his laptop had locked up again. Normally we have a ticketing system in place for any and all tech issues. However when an exec wants something he bypasses the system because of RHIP. So I go through the normal routine of diagnosis and through my efforts I see that the issue is simply bad ram. I replace the ram and take the unit back to the exec. 

He tells me he refuses to take the unit unless I have made 100 percent sure that everything that was wrong with it is fixed. Internally I wanted to punch this man but I held it in and simply asked him what other issues he was having and pulled out a notepad. He ran through a load of issues that all screamed ""just run fkin ccleaner"" to me and I took his unit back to my desk. 

After going through and cleaning out BS installed programs used literally once and never again and cleaning out junk data, I found that a folder in his roaming was reading 12GB but was hidden. I log in with my creds and enable viewing hidden or protected files and I see that the hidden folder was from 2014. Basically it was just a bunch of pictures and looked to be a temp folder created by one of the old programs I removed. Some kind of picture manager or some such. 

Normally when we see personal pictures on the machine we are supposed to delete them immediately. Now no one EVER does this as we are not that big of dicks in the IT dept. Plus this guy was an exec so I decided to just move the pictures to his desktop under a folder I created called Old Pics. 

I took the laptop to him and informed him of the pics telling him I left it up to him if he wanted them deleted or not. He thanked me for my time and I went back to work. 

About an hour later him and his wife, who had come up to join him for lunch, came over to my desk. He seemed very happy and she was crying. 

Now normally when I have nothing to do and a boss comes over, I stand up to greet them. Just the way I was raised I guess. I was not prepared for what followed and was totally shocked by the outcome. 

The lady wanted to thank me for finding the pictures and the exec reached out to shake my hand thanking me profusely before pulling me into a hug in front of the entire IT department. I awkwardly hugged him back and he let me go embarrassed. My eyes are wide flabbergasted and totally unprepared for this, extremely, out of character moment from this guy. 

Barely able to hold back the tears, his wife tells me that the pictures I recovered were thought to be lost. In 2012 their 4 year old son had died of lukemia and the pictures I recovered were taken right before his diagnosis at 3 years of age. Because of a  house fire a few years ago they thought they lost every last photo of their son. Apparently those were the photos I had recovered. 

His wife reached out to hug me and everyone in the IT department stared at their screens hard with puffy eyes as we were all not expecting this kind of emotional event today.

My boss came out of his office to personally thank me and forwarded an email chain to me ahead of a company wide email that the CEO sent out basically retelling the tale while naming me personally. He threw in words about striving for excellence and the unexpected results of every day excellence. 

I had to turn off my skype for business as the attaboys kept coming in one after the other. My boss told me to take my lunch early since the flood of messages was making it hard to do my job. 

EDIT: Post this before lunch one day, don't log into reddit for a bit, realize post went nuclear. RIP inbox. Thanks for the gold you 9 kind redditors. "
talesfromtechsupport,"I work in a store that offers technical support for consumer-level technology.

A few days ago I had an elderly gentleman that we'll call Pete (name changed for privacy). Our receptionist made him a walk-in appointment earlier that day and I ended up taking it. When I opened it all up, the only notes I saw were ""Third-party software, hard of hearing.""

I walked up to Pete and greeted him, saw that he was staring at my lips as to read them, then I asked if he knew American Sign Language (ASL). I've been trying to learn ASL it as a sort of side-hobby for a few months now. Pete signs ""yes"" and we continue the conversation in Sign. Turns out the issue is with Skype, which keeps crashing on his roughly 5-year old tablet, and he's been having difficulty video-calling his wife who is Deaf.

She lives in a different continent, she travelled there for a temporary work opportunity and would be there for two years. This being the mid-way point, it's now been 1 year since Pete's seen his wife. Skype is the only way they both know how to communicate efficiently long-distance, as neither are comfortable with email or other text-based services.

As I go through verifying that he knows his password and making sure there's a backup of his device, Pete and I are signing back and forth and his face was completely lit up. I felt so good to be able to, albeit slowly, speak with him in his language and give him the time he deserved, even if his reason for visiting us had little to do with our physical product.

Once everything was verified and backed up, I uninstalled Skype and reinstalled it, had Pete sign in, and use Skype's test call to ensure it wouldn't crash (as it would immediately upon call creation before). Test call went through fine. Sweet.

I looked down to write a few extra notes and began to hear some coughs. I looked up and there was Pete, crying while waving to his wife through Skype. Pete called her and she picked up! He introduced me to her and told me that it'd been 3-weeks since they'd heard from each other. I stepped away to give him a moment alone.

It's moments like these that keep me going as a technician. Even though I barely touched Pete's tablet, ""fixing"" it made me feel like a hero. It's been a few days and I can still see his smile.

Just thought I'd share, thanks for reading.

Obligatory: Wow, this exploded overnight! Thank you all for your kind words. Seeing the response I've gotten from all of you has made this experience even better! You guys are an amazing community."
talesfromtechsupport,"I work as an Executive Support Technician for a large company, I have a team of 8 people under me and we support high ranking executives and their administrative assistants.


Because of the nature of our work, we have the ability to ""get things done"" that the standard help desk cannot, We can force upgrades that would otherwise be denied, get things expedited, skip the normal procedures and talk directly with the people who fix the issues. 


While we are executive support, there are still levels, when the CEO is in town, one of us is camped outside of where ever he might be in case there is any sort of issue. 

For lower people, we make sure things get done as quick as possible, but it's not a drop everything situation.

As we prepped for the releases of the new iPhones, we braced for the flood of ""I NEED this"" that inevitably happens.  We slot in orders immediately for the top of the pyramid guys, and then work our way down, replacing, or sometimes having to tell them that they have to wait because the device they have is too new to warrant replacing. 

So on Monday, the EA of a lower end Exec put in a request to get both herself and the exec new 256 Gig iPhone X's

The Exec was put on the approval list, with a wait, but the EA was denied.  She had just been issued an iPhone 7 a few months ago, and she began to raise hell about ""I have to support him, so I need to have the exact same phone etc etc"" 

Still denied.

On Tuesday, I get a ticket from the EA - iPhone will not turn on, require replacement with attached ticket for iPhone X request.

I send one of my drones out to investigate and I immediately get a text saying I have to get out there, I get out there and the iPhone is wet, not just wet, but dripping wet, like just pulled out of a glass of water wet with a screen that could only be called heavily Cracked.

the EA states ""I was using it and it fell into my water bottle"" 

So we take the phone back to our area and I've called my manager over and we explain it, It's obvious what has happened,  We've toweled it off and when we turn it over, water drizzles out of the cracked screen. 

Well as luck would have it, we have spares, so I pluck a nice 64 gig Rose Gold iPhone 6s that was returned when the previous owner departed the company, I call and have the sim reprovisioned, I re-assign the phone in Airwatch and I have the phone returned to the EA.

10 minutes later, said EA is at our door, ranting, screaming saying that she can't work like this, she needs a new phone and if we don't give her one ""EXECUTIVE"" will make us give her one.  I step in and tell her ""A permanent replacement is just beginning the process, we have had to issue you this phone as a loaner so you can continue working until a permanent replacement is sourced""

Queue Wednesday, the approval process has come back denied for her replacement, the loaner phone is now her permanent phone.  This info is relayed to the EA, who is fuming, lots of ""EXECUTIVE WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS"" and statements of ""I can't believe this is happening to me, how will I work?"" 

Wednesday afternoon, same EA, new ticket - iPhone broken, need replacement.  I head out myself to see the issue and the phone looks like it was dragged behind a semi truck for 100 miles, the screen is shattered, a big chunk missing out the top near the camera, big dents in the back.  I calmly ask ""What happened? This phone was perfect this morning?""

The reply: ""Well, since you gave me an old phone, my case didn't fit and it slipped out of my hands and fell down the stairs.""

Well ok, could you tell me when and what stairwell this happened? she does, and I take the mangled phone, I grab my manager and we head off to the security office, and we pull the tapes.

On the video we see the EA walking up the stairwell (concrete stairs, metal hand rail, your typical big building non public stairwell) she reaches the top and proceeds to fling the phone, like one would skip a stone, down from the 6floor to the mid floor landing, where it lands, she steps on it and then kicks it down to the 5th floor, it bangs off the metal fire door and she picks it up, examines it and then tosses it down the stairs to towards the 4th floor, bouncing off a few steps before landing on the mid landing between 5 and 4.

She picks the device up, and pries a large section of something off the phone (We suspect this was the chunk missing by the camera) and then heads back up the stairs, running the phone against the cinder block wall as she climbs. 

So we grab a copy of the video, we head straight to HR, we sit with the personnel director, we show her the video, we show her the 2 damaged iPhones, we show her the tickets, I relay the abuse thrown to myself and my techs about how she demands an iPhone X and has taken to destroying company property to get it. 

Termination follows, however the user has gone home for the day, her accounts are disabled, her security badge flagged.  

7:30 am today, the EA attempts to get into the building and her badge does not work, so she has to walk to the security office, the security officer takes the badge, and walks her to HR.

8 am, the Security officer and two members of HR are escorting the EA out of the building, she's alternating between yelling and crying, Demanding that EXECUTIVE be called and that she's being framed.

As she's brought through the main foyer, I'm on the 2nd floor balcony that overlooks the entrance, she looks up at me, curses me and is gone.

Both phones, her laptop and other equipment have been placed with the Legal team as a precaution. Company policy when there is a messy separation.

Maybe I'll buy my team pizza for lunch today, seems like the right thing to do.

TLDR; Executive Assistant breaks iPhones in her quest to get an iPhone X, gets unemployment instead. "
talesfromtechsupport,"LTL FTP, etc.This happened last year, but a recent post elsewhere sparked the memory

Little Background: I work IT at my college, usually I work in back so I don't have to deal with people, but once a week I get to grace the helpdesk. My school gives it's students a lot of privacy and they can decide what the school can release to other people when they come for orientation, it ranges from we're an open book to we can't verify the students existance. This student selected, we cannot verfy his existance which applies to everyone that is not an immediate family member.


So be me, bored out of my skull watching the minutes tick by of the last 5 minutes of my shift, ready to get dinner. I get a call from whom shall be known as $apache (very agressive helicopter parent, hence attack helicopter).


**$me**: Thank you for calling $myschool ITS help desk how can I help you


**$apache**: Hello! My name is $Apache and my son goes to the school, but is having trouble logging in to $ouronlinepanelforstudents can you give me his password?


**$me**: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble however we do not keep students passwords on record, however if he is having issues with it he can reset it online, call us, or come down to $buildingwe'rein to come get it fixed!


**$apache**: OK can I get it reset then? He really needs to get in


**$Me**: I'm sorry but it has to be him who asks to get it reset, I can't do it for anyone else


**$apache**: But I'm his mother, I can get it reset for him


**$me**: I'm sorry but it _has to be him_ who comes and gets it reset, it can't be anyone else, even his immediate family


**$apache**: But I'm his mother, I've done everything for him


**$me**: I understand that, but college policy states that only the student can request a password reset


**$apache**: I'M HIS GODAMN MOTHER YOU INCOMPETANT PEICE OF SHIT, GIVE ME HIS GODAMN PASSWORD


At this point I know it's about to get fun, I look back at my manager, who is totally awesome and loves stuff like this, and signal her to get on the line and listen.


**$me**: I understand your frustration, however I can't go against college policy, I would reccomend that you call your son and tell him to call us to get is password reset. 


**$apache**: NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME YOU LITTLE SHIT, IF YOU DON'T RESET 
$hersonandpersonIknow's PASSWORD RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO GET YOU FIRED


Her son was one of the guys who lived on my floor and I knew, but wasn't really friends with.


**$me**: Ok, let me talk to my manager and see what I can do.

I go back to my manager who is already smiling about this lady, and I tell her I know this guy and if it's alright to text him and let him know that his mom is on the phone asking to chage his password. Since its about his account she says go for it.


**$me** -> **$myfriend**: Yo buddy your mom is on the phone cursing me out cause I won't change your password, did you need it reset?


**$myfriend**: What no. I know my password, why is she calling you?


**$me**: She's saying you forgot your password and is now going off the walls, I put her on hold and I'm sure she's steaming at this point


**$myfriend**: Wait, what's her name?


**$me**: $apache


**$myfriend**: lol that's not even my mom it's my stepmom. 


If you remember from the very beginning this student had selected the ""I dont exist to the outside world"" privacy package, so now we could have even more fun with the attack helicopter parent

_back on the phone_


**$me**: Hello $apache?


**$apache**: Yes! What took you so long!!


**$me**: Sorry I was just looking over some information and I don't see you on our files anywhere being related to any of our students.


**$apache**: So what! I just want my sons pasword!


**$me**: I'm sorry, but we have parents of our students on record and youre not on any of them


**$apache**: $student is my step-son! That's a son!


**$me**: I'm sorry, we can't release any information at all to anyone that's not an immeditate family member. 


**$apache**: He goes to the school and I'm his mother! Give me his password!


**$me**: I'm sorry I cannot verify $student's enrollment at our school.


**$apache**: WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN YOU LITTLE SHIT, I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU FIRED.


At this point my manager is giving me the ""cut the call"" sign so I just tell her:


**$me**: I'm sorry I couldnt be more help, thank you for calling $school. Have a nice rest of your day


**$apache**: DON'T HANG UP ON ME YOU LITTLE SH-   *click*

It was now 5:04, 4 minutes past the end of my shift so I get up and leave. Apparently she called back 5 minutes later and went balistic on one of the other nerds who works at the desk."
talesfromtechsupport,"The repair company I work at is a small business and has two locations, one of which is in an interesting area. As such, we get a lot of interesting people. This guy came in yesterday. 

**$User:** ""Hi, can you show me how to access someone's text messages? I found some tutorials on YouTube but they didn't work""  
*I assume he wants to backup the messages so I start walking him through how to sync his phone*  
**$User:** ""No no no, I want someone else's messages""  
**$Me:** ""Wait, this isn't a device you own?""  
**$User:** ""No""  
**$Me:** ""Do you have consent from the owner to read their messages?""  
**$User:** ""No, that's why I need you to show me how to see them""  
**$Me:** ""Sir, if you don't have permission from the other person to read their messages it's illegal to access them. I can't show you how to do that here""  
**$User:** ""Well do you know anywhere else that can""  
$Me: ""No sir, I'm not aware of any other repair shops that can help you do that, it's a federal crime. I can pull up the relevant laws regarding unauthorized access to someone's personal devices if you'd like""

*Cue standard rant of ""you guys are supposed to be the experts"" as I stare blankly into the distance losing more faith in humanity*"
talesfromtechsupport,"Another tale from the out of hours IT desk...

**Me:** Service Desk

**Caller:** GOOGLE BING ISNT WORKING IS THE SYSTEM DOWN ??? ITS VERY IMPORTANT I USE THE BING

*Note: yes, caller actually said ""the bing""*

**Me:** I'm sorry - can you confirm which system you're referring to as I'm unfamiliar with that

**Caller:** Google Bing! Really how can you not know this

**Me:** Google Bing is not a system we support out of hours nor in hours. This sounds like a mash up between two different search engines. What exactly is happening?

**Caller:** I need Google Bing to do my job! This is unacceptable. I can't find Google Bing anywhere on my PC. How dare you remove this! I need you to fix Google Bing immediately!

**Me:** May I remote in to take a look

<spend 5 mins setting up remote connection>

Turns out that caller had a shortcut on her desktop called ""Google Bing"" - this opened the Bing Search homepage in Google Chrome *shivers*. She'd accidentally changed the name of the shortcut from ""Google Bing"" to something else and hence could not find it.

**Me:** okay - that has been renamed now so you're good to go

**Caller:** next time don't mess around with my computer! I know you guys changed this, I'm not stupid! I have a certificate of proficiency in computering

**Me:** okay thanks for calling *click*

*Note: yes caller really said ""computering""*

I died a little inside after taking this call."
talesfromtechsupport,"This just happened...

So, I had a laptop system board fail. Under warranty. No problem.

Engineer comes on site. Does the  job. All good.

10 minutes later, I'm called down to where he was working by a member of management saying that he must have been doing drugs in there because there's a syringe in the bin. There's about 10 members of staff all freaking out.

It's thermal compound.

Edit: damn this got big! My biggest post ever!"
talesfromtechsupport,"I work Helpdesk for a retail store chain in the UK. I had a call from a store about a till drawer that wasn't opening after a transaction.

>me: Could you check that the till is plugged in to the back of the pc?

>user: Sure, one second.. (I hear him rummaging under the desk)

>user: yeah, It's plugged in

*The POS software occasionally forgets which COM port to operate for the till drawer*

>me: I'm just going to try to open the drawer manually. Can you stand back from the drawer so it doesn't hit you.

>user: haha, sure!

*I open up CMD and try to open the drawer*

    echo a> COM1

*... nothing*

    echo a> COM2

**UGHHHHH.. Thud**

>me: Hello? I heard something, did the drawer open?

>user: ...

>me: Hello?

*After around 20 seconds a woman picks up the phone laughing*
>user2: *User* had to go to the bathroom to clean his nose, the till drawer hit him in face and bust his nose. We'll call you back later!

Whenever I want to reach through the screen and smack a user, I'll always think back to this story and remember that it's possible."
talesfromtechsupport,"So my story starts on what was a normal day taking calls on the front line for a large cable company.  The job pays well and for the most part the people I deal with are fairly nice to talk to.

Quite often we'll get calls from seniors (especially in the morning) who have premise equipment issues such as ""snow on screen"" or ""no signal"" on their TV sets connected to our digital equipment. 

Now my heart does go out to some of these folk because up until recently (past few years) we would supply straight analog cable to many homes (coax direct from wall to TV with scrolling guide).  However most cities we service nowadays require our digital equipment to receive channels, and this has caused a lot of frustration with older people who don't know how to operate said equipment (ie. always having your TV set on ""video"" or ""hdmi"" to get picture).  So often times we get customers who are repeat offenders with long ticket histories of these types of issues.

So anyway, I get a call from an older gentleman who's quite bitter and mean right off the bat (doesn't like that I asked for his address / telephone number to verify the account, hates that he has to speak with a machine before reaching an agent, etc.).  I have some experience handling these types of customers, however this call was going to be a little different.

I spent over 45 minutes with this guy (we'll call him Mr. Smith) trying to get his TV set connected to the digital box properly so he could receive a picture.  No luck.  He was getting clearly frustrated by the whole ordeal and started blaming me for not being able to do my job properly, how I was useless, etc. 

Whatever.

Like I said, I've dealt with this before so I tried my best not to take it personally, but eventually I had to ask him if we could book a service tech to the home (a courtesy call) to get his TV working correctly.  Unfortunately, our booking calendar was showing an appointment 3 days out.   That's when he dropped this on me:

""Don't bother sending a goddamn technician, because I'll be dead by then.  I'm 94 and TV is the only thing I have left, are you really going to make me wait for a tech?""

I instantly felt bad.  I mean, I've heard every complaint in the book as to why people don't want to wait for a tech but this one kind of got to me.  I'm in my mid-20's so honestly I can't even imagine how it must feel to utter those words.

So I spoke with my supervisor, who said they'd see if we could get someone out earlier...but we couldn't promise anything.  So I let Mr. Smith know and he was predictably not very happy with my answer.  

At that point it almost sounded like he started to cry and went into how he has no family left, and no friends that come visit (this was after I asked if there was anyone in his building that might be able to help).  Man.  I felt terrible, so I took it upon myself to ask Mr. Smith if I could pay a visit (he lived in a small city over from where I was, not very far to drive).  

He was a little shocked I was willing to do this, but sounded thankful I was willing to come out and help him personally.

So I head over, get to the residence and meet him - within 30 seconds I had the cable running again (simple input change) and even brought him a simplified remote for his set top box to avoid this problem in the future.

That's when he started crying.  He goes into how he hasn't actually spoken or really interacted with anyone for years.  He gave me a hug and told me how thankful he was that I came out and helped him, and told me how sorry he was for being so mean earlier on.  I said it was no problem and I was happy to help, and that was it - I left.

3 weeks later, my supervisor comes to my desk and asks me if I could come speak with her for a bit about an account for ""Mr. Smith"".  Turns out, he sent the cable company a letter outlining how thankful he was for helping him with his issue and how it really ""made an old man happy again for once in a very long time"".  The letter was framed and put on our front entrance to retail.

I guess the moral of this story is no matter how nasty someone is to you over the phone, sometimes they're not always a terrible person and just going through a lot.  I still think about Mr. Smith occasionally when I get those nasty customers and it makes me feel a little better.

Anyway thanks for reading just thought I'd share how this one call changed my outlook on life :)

> $Usr - But I am back now.  

*Are you a rubbish chat bot sent to test me?*

> $Me  - You need to tell the HR system when you came back so it unlocks your profile.  
> $Usr - Can't it tell?  
> $Me  - How would it tell?  
> $Usr - Well I am in the building and logged into my computer, is that not enough?  

*This is a test, has to be a test, am I getting secret shoppered???*

> $Me  - The systems aren't linked in that way. People come into work all the time when off on holiday or sick to drop things off/collect things. If the system logged that as a day in work then holiday and sick pay would be all messed up. We also have a number of remote users who are never in the office.  
> $Usr - So how do I sort this out?  

*ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?*

> $Me  - Fill in the date field!!!!!

*I need to get out of this call!*

> $Me  - Can I remote onto your system and help you sort it.  
> $Usr - Would you mind. It might be easier.  

*Too F'in right it'll be easier*  

> $Me  - Ok, I am on and I'll just add today's date in here and we're all set.  
> $Usr - So I am back now?  
> $Me  - Yes, you're no-longer being shown as off sick.  
> $Usr - Can you reset my password while I've got you on?  

*Please please please IT gods, don't do this to me*  

> $Me  - What's wrong with your password?  
> $Usr - Nothing, but I got the about to expire message when I logged in and I want to you to reset it for me.  
> $Me  - You can change your password yourself by clicking the change password link when you see that screen or wait for it to expire and you'll be forced to do it when you next log in.  
> $Usr - I don't want to change my password.  

*You did this to me...*

> $Me  - You have to change your password every 60 days.  
> $Usr - Can't you just give me another 60 days?  
> $Me  - The policy of changing it is for security.  
> $Usr - My password is very secure.  

*Ok $Usr, I want to play a game...*

> $Me  - Ok, what's your current password?  
> $Usr - It's $actuallyquitesecurepassword.  
> $Me  - Ok, now that you have told me your password it is no longer secure and I must insist you change it immediately.  
> $Usr - You work in IT you knew my password anyway!  
> $Me  - No, all passwords are secure. I can reset passwords but I can not look at them. As I am still connected to you I will help you change it now.  

Proceed to open the password change menu for $User. $User fills in the fields and gets an error saying that new password is a previously used password and thus can't be allowed.

> $Usr - Passwords are hard to remember.  
> $Me  - Just pick a couple of random words and then add a number and a symbol.  
> $Usr - what do you mean?  
> $Me  - Like DeskMugPhonePencil1! Just pick a few things you can see from your desk and ta da! Easy to remember.

*$Usr's new password is 100% going to be DeskMugPhonePencil1!*

Some Task Manager lore: I'm the Microsoft (Redmond, '93) developer that wrote TaskMgr at home in my den in about 1994 and then the NT silverback devs let me check it into the main tree even though I was a greenhorn at the time.  So that meant I got to bring it into work and polish it up and make it an official part of Windows, where it remains to this day.  So I got to define my own day job, actually, which was nice!  I don't know if it's still like that, but great culture and people.

This is all based on XP, as I left long ago, but it's still the same core app underneath.  In no particular order:

\- If Task Manager ever hangs or crashes, start another by pressing ctrl-shift-esc.  Winlogon will look for an existing instance and try to revive it for up to 10 seconds.  If the old Taskmgr doesn't start making sense by responding with a secret code within that time, another one will be launched.  That way, you're never without a Taskmgr as long as there are some resources available.

\- Task Manager will load in reduced mode if resources are short, like only loading the Processes page if that's what's needed to get going.  It's one of the very few apps that won't just ""fail and bail"" when things go wrong.

\- If Task Manager ever becomes internally corrupted, kill/close it.  Restart it while holding down CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT, and Task Manager will reset ALL internal settings to factory fresh if it sees that key combo at startup.  Same works for every app I've written, btw, I think!

\- If all your titlebars disappear and you just have a graph, double-click dead client space to switch back to normal mode.  This no-titlebar mode is a mode I added to follow the NT clock, where you could remove borders as well, but it confused more people than it ever helped I'm sure!

\- I initially drew the meters as 7-segment LEDs but that wasn't localizable to all cultures (How do you do a right-to-left reading 7-segment LED for Saudi Arabia?) so they only lasted for one version or so.

\- CTRL-SHIFT-ESC will launch Taskmgr without any help from the Shell, so if the Shell/Explorer is dead use this key combo to bring up TM and then reset/restart the shell.  Even if your tray is missing and gone, this combo should start it.

\- If the shell can't start something or is hung, try Task Manager.  It has a mode where it will load without ANY references to the shell32.dll and allow you to start programs like CMD.EXE without the start menu.

\- You can find the binary for any executing process in the process table by right clicking and pick ""Show File Location"".  You can also search it online, but I don't know if they have useful info for much.

\- There should be nothing that TaskMgr can't kill - it will even escalate privilege and (if you have it) enable debug privilege to attach to and kill apps that way if needed.  If TM can't kill it, you've got a kernel problem.

\- A lot of people don't seem to know you can add many additional columns, remove others, drag them around to reorder, etc.

\- The reason there's a Window class called ""DavesFrameWndProc"" is because to get flicker-free resizing I needed group boxes to not try to paint on one another, so subclass them, give them their own wndproc, and enabling WS\_CLIPSIBLINGS during WM\_CREATE.  At least I think so!

\- TM is one of the apps I'm most proud of because it is probably the first or at least most visually complicated app to ever be fully resizable in all dimensions without any flicker up till then.  I was hardcore about memory and flicker in my day, so it was under 100K for the exe and never flashed or crashed, that was my thing!  Having the GDI32 and User32 guys down the hall sure helped.

I also wrote/ported Space Cadet pinball, zip folders, worked on start menu, shell, calc, ole32, product activation, and some other stuff.  I was in MS-DOS before that but I doubt anyone is still supporting MS-DOS!  


Edit:  Looks like comments have been locked, so I'll update this one time with some answers to the most interesting/common questions below!  


\- On the command line, I'm stumped, as I don't remember command line args to it at all!

\- On Space Cadet, yes, you can run it on Windows 10, but I doubt it's official or legal, so will point you at your favorite search engine for that one, but it's easy.  And on Space Cadet, reminder that Maxis did the very original (M. Ridgeway) and mine was just a rewrite in 32-bit portable C using their art.  That way it ran on the PowerPC, Alpha, and MIPS as well.  And yes, in the original there is a ""God Mode"" where you can drag the ball around, click on targets, etc.  Search is your friend there as well.

\- On what I'm doing these days, I volunteer to teach kids to program at school, or used to until recently, so now I'm mostly coding and working on my coding channel, which you can follow here: [https://bit.ly/36wDLJK](https://bit.ly/36wDLJK) and I also restore old musclecars, pickups, etc.  So yes, I still code every day!

\- On the notion that there are some things that Taskmgr can't kill, there were post-XP for sure but they were intentional limits.  I remember something about journalists making news by using TM to kill the root winlogon session, for example, which would bugcheck the machine intentionally.  But the fact you could bluescreen NT didn't look good, I suspect, so they likely started to protect people from themselves by disallowing killing win32k.sys and other essential components.  

\- Thanks to the mods for being flexible on this one!  "

techsupport,"I have been at it 6 hours trying to do it myself.  My lawyer has a guy that does it for $2,500 - but that is way out of my wheelhouse.  I'd pay for help if the video was recovered, but I'm not the kind of guy with more than $500 to ""play"" with.  I know your time is valuable, so let me know what you need to do it.  I will answer any questions you have up-front and with pure honesty.

EDIT:  Anybody in the Houston area I will come to personally.
EDIT 2:  All good advice got gold, I left a comment asking for PayPal info to compensate the best of the thread.  Thank you.  Please send me your PayPal info.

EDIT 3:  Got up to take a piss at 2:30am, and holy shit.  Let me clarify a few things.  1) I was not belligerent - not until I had the knee in my face - then it was mostly ""what the fuck.""  2) I don't care to waste my time suing anyone who doesn't deserve it.  Karma in real life might actually be a real thing.  3)  I don't need to beat a DUI.  They took the blood without an arrest and without a warrant.  In Texas, that gets suppressed with a quickness.  4)If I was acting like a belligerent asshole,  show me one cop that wouldn't take me in right then.  5) Regardless of all that other BS and the court of Reddit administering a verdict, I still really, really need this video.

EDIT 4:  2 things - 1... I am working through all of your suggestions (making a list now, setting up in the morning). PHONE IS OFF.  I had 20GB of free space on the internal.  No SD, no Cloud, No Hamster.  2....  I know as much as the next guy how people can be on the internet.  That's not me.  Know why?  Because I'm trying to get the video back, that's why.  What the fuck would I want of a video of me deservedly getting attacked after treating a medical team like shit?  ""I'm Rob Lowe and this is Dickhead Asshat Doctor Provoking Rob Lowe with cable?""

EDIT 5 (Tuesday): No rooting programs are working.  I copied every folder from my phone to my computer.  It turns out that Verizon's SM-N910V has something called a bootblocker or some shit like that.  So I am on to manually try this out.

EDIT 6 (Tuesday Afternoon):  There is no way to root this phone without dealing with a bootloader or something that every forum says we have to wait for.  I contacted a Data Forensics company in Austin that might be able to do something, but if I have to go that route I am going to have to wait until I get paid on the 15th.  They are going to call me back sometime today to let me know if they can even do anything.  Meanwhile, any suggestions that require the phone to be rooted are no good.  I can't thank y'all enough, though.  I'll deliver something as soon as I figure out what I need to do next.

EDIT 7 (Tuesday still):  I have a call with the guy from Austin at 2pm or so Central - I'll let y'all know what he thinks.

EDIT 8 (Tues.):  They are going to email me some detailed info regarding what they do to get the video.  Obviously, I probably won't understand one fucking detail, but I'll post it here.  For now, you guys stay awesome.  I need to get some work done.

EDIT 9:  YOU GUYS ARE ABOVE-AVERAGE!!!!  A company in Oklahoma just offered to forensically recover the video for me as pro-bono, pro-civil right, just plain badass way to help me out.  Once again, no matter what....  I will post the video as soon as I can, no matter how it makes me look.   I am Fed-Exing the phone there this afternoon.

EDIT 10:  Continuing my policy of ""surely delivering"" I give you a copy of the [overnight shipping receipt.](http://imgur.com/xCeaNpf)

EDIT 11:  Not much new today to report except that my phone arrived at the Data Forensics facility.  FedEx Tracking 807519987715

EDIT 12:  Wednesday activities:  Phone will be dumped by Thursday morning when recovery work will commence.

EDIT 13:  Got an email this morning (Thursday) saying they are recovering the data today.  That does not mean shit to the great reveal.  I made the mistake of scrolling too low in some of the other threads this ended up on, and I am not having my integrity questioned anymore - at least where I can do something about it.  [This is my Uber receipt](http://imgur.com/iRjEBul) from the night of the incident showing that I went HOME and did not, as some claim, have a DWI that I am just covering up for.  Check the address, it is the hospital - not the jail.

EDIT 14:  I had another update from the guys in OKC with my phone.  They were able to pull a lot of old contacts, messages, etc. from my phone, but no video.  They want to use a new code they have for this new phone (Verizon Note 4) to see what they can get.  They estimate a Tuesday completion.  That does not mean I am going to upload the video if I get it right away.  My attorney and ABC-13 in Houston are going to make sure that anything I upload does not violate HIPPA laws.  I am here for any other questions anyone has, but you have to be as patient as I am before I upload the video.  I spoke with my attorney today and he is being very cautious about how we go about this.  I got a copy of my medical records from that night which are full of contradictory statements.  You all can expect no updates over the weekend.  Not because I am being deceptive, but mostly because my attorney has a newborn, I need to catch up with my job, and the guys in OKC don't work over the weekend.  This is going to be a process, and as much as I want to deliver ASAP, the data is going to be delivered and the story develops --- and that shit takes time.  I am always available to answer questions if you message me.

EDIT 15 (Monday Night):  Nothing new to report.  Last Friday I was told that there would be either a yes or no on recovery by close of business on Tuesday.  I'm not rushing anybody, so I didn't ask for an update today.  I probably will tomorrow.  I see all of the ""RemindMe"" things, and I want you all to know that it is still in the works.  The sheer amount of professionalism going into this is going to be a valuable addition to the people on this sub that I intended to interact with before this blew up.  I think we are all going to be in a position to learn ""real(ish) time"" how they are handling this.  I don't know dick-one about what is going on technically with my phone, but I'm sure we'll get some insight soon.

EDIT 16 (Tuesday Night):  There is still nothing new to report.  

EDIT 17 (Wednesday Afternoon):  The email from the data forensics company:

>Hello again Reddit friend,
>
>Long story short, you are boned. Our forensic devices were able to semi-dump this phone, but the video you are looking for was not in the dumps.
>
>So here is the long story. The Verizon Note 4 is bootloader locked with no known exploit. It has several security systems in place to make sure you (the owner) don't get to do anything with the phone that Samsung and VZW dont approve of, UNLESS you buy the Verizon Note 4 'Developer Edition'. The reason that this matters to you, is that there is no way currently to access a full bit-for-bit copy of the internal storage.

>Our resident Android Guru has been working on this solid since we got your phone (partly because of the almost $15000 reward for it), but is up against a wall as well.
>
>In effect, you are out of luck on recovering the video until an exploit is found for this phone (which it may or may not ever be). Your options are to keep the phone safe and unused somewhere until the phones security is broken, or to move on.
>
>I wish we had better news, and I wish that Android phone manufacturers would keep these open source phones open, and not locked like Fort Knox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Knox).

>Please get me your shipping address and we will overnight the phone back to you. I am sorry, and I know this is not what you were hoping for, us either!

They also included a spreadsheet breaking down the bounty for unlocking the phone.  Either way, this is good information for this sub, I'd assume, and bad for the people with the pictchforks and such.  My attorney is still moving forward, and that is going to be a long process, so if your ""RemindMe"" shit doesn't have ""months"" somewhere in it, you can forget that.

Seriously, the internet is awesome when you look at it from the standpoint of I cane to this sub to get a result and I got one (good or bad).  It sucks when apparently I became a ""Karma Whore"" somewhere in here.  You all can think what you want, but seriously, how does this matter to your life?  Stop being so cynical.  In the words of [Conan O'Brien.](http://youtu.be/AcF1OoWqXBc?t=3m47s)

EDIT 18 (Feb 16):  Some of y'all need to get a life.  I'm not some cop-bashing anti-anything attention seeker.  I came here for a tech support issue and got exactly that.  If the result isn't what you had hoped for, too goddamned bad, go upstairs and cry to your mom.  The people who help out in here are awesome, and shouldn't have to deal with some of you terrible, terrible human beings who for whatever reason think that the reading and commenting on a story makes them somehow entitled to anything. Nobody owes you shit, get used to it.  

Final Outcome (November):  The company from Oklahoma tried to get the video out of the phone for no charge and could not get it. I knew that the hospital had cameras and I tried to get a lawyer where I am to take the case on a contingency fee basis which was unsuccessful. Not an exciting conclusion to the story, but it is what it is.  Thank you all, I hope you all have a happy holiday season.

Super Three-Year-Later Edit: This pissed me off so much, I went to law school and became an attorney and now do defense work in Texas. 

Super Duper Edit - This turned into a radio episode, and yes, apparently you can edit this shit in perpetuity. http://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2018/09/07/tim-from-texas"

 *If you suspect you are infected with any form of malware that encrypts your files, DO NOT follow this guide! Please make a post instead. Your files are at stake.*

&#x200B;

**Tip:** Windows 7 and below is no longer supported by Microsoft and UNSAFE to use. If you are still running Windows 7 with a LEGIT license, you can obtain a free upgrade to Windows 10 by using the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) from Microsoft. They have been very generous in continuing to allow users to upgrade from Windows 7 at no charge. *Do this upgrade AFTER your system has been cleaned of malware. A system image backup is highly recommended before starting this process. This backup can be performed to an external hard drive with the* [Backup & Restore tool](https://i.imgur.com/B0I3FgI.png) *located in the Control Panel on Windows 7 and up.*

 

**Purpose & Scope of this Guide:**

This guide is designed to assist you in removing malware from an infected system *that successfully boots*. If your computer is completely unable to boot due to malware, please make a post, as this guide will not help you. If you perform the following steps exactly as described, this will solve your problem in over 90% of scenarios. That said, not all malware is created equal, and not all malware removal tools are created equal. The tools recommended in this guide were picked because of their high success and low failure rates, measured on a very large scale. However, there will be times that this guide fails in removing malware. If that is the case, please make a post for further assistance, stating that this guide was unsuccessful. It is recommended to only accept advice from a “Trusted” technician. I am writing this guide in layman’s terms so that most people will be able to understand it with ease.

 

**Disclaimer:**

The following instructions are recommendations only. You take full responsibility for any steps you choose to perform on your computer. While the following recommendations are performed without issue on countless machines, there is always a risk of damaging your Operating System or experiencing data loss on any machine. **It is solely YOUR responsibility to save all work and back up any and all important data on your system before proceeding.** 

 

**Malware Remediation Steps:**

*Before proceeding, go into your browser’s extensions and remove all suspicious items. Also go into your browser’s settings and remove any default search providers and unusual homepages. If you are unsure how to do this, proceed to Step 1.*

 

*Download and run the following tools in this order. Run all tools unless otherwise instructed. All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or the scans fail in Normal Mode. All tools must be run under an Administrator account. Do not remove any tool-generated logs in the event a helper needs you to post them to further assist you.*

 

**1) Run** [**rkill.com**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/dl/10/)**. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to finish. Do not reboot when done.**

* Kills running malicious processes
* Removes policies in the registry that prevent normal OS operation
* Repairs file extension hijacks

 

**2) Download an updated copy** [**Malwarebytes 4.0**](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/)**. Turn on the “**[**Scan for Rootkits**](https://i.imgur.com/5lLJB3R.png)**” option. Then, run a “**[**Scan**](https://i.imgur.com/fDFSVy4.png)**”**

* Successfully removes the vast majority of infections
* Has an industry-leading, lightning fast scanning  & heuristics engine
* Has built-in repair tools to fix damage done by malware

 

**3) Run** [**Malwarebytes ADWCleaner 8**](https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/) **using the “**[**Scan Now**](https://i.imgur.com/hwFbaQZ.png)**” button.**

* Removes majority of adware, PuPs, Toolbars, and Browser hijacks
* Scans for bloatware & pre-installed sofware and lets you quarantine any or all of it.
* Fixes proxy settings changed by malware
* Removes certain non-default browser settings

 

 

**Optional, Advanced Step (only run if previous tools fail to solve problem):**

**4) Run Sophos** [**HitmanPro**](http://get.hitmanpro.com/)

* [Here](https://i.imgur.com/oT7CjuN.png) is HitmanPro.

HitmanPro is a phenomenal ""second-opinion"" malware scanner. I recommend clicking ""Settings"" and uncheck ""Scan for tracking cookies"" before starting the scan. This will drastically reduce scan times. This tool can only be run ONCE for free. Use it wisely.

 

**Please note:** If malware has prohibited you from browsing the web or downloading files, you can try running the [NetAdapter Repair Tool](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/netadapter-repair-all-in-one/)  with [all options checked](http://i.imgur.com/XLv1ZUW.png) which will attempt to restore your internet connection & default browser settings. You may have to download these tools on another computer and move them to a flash drive that you can plug into the infected machine.

 

**Think your Mac is infected?**

Try [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/). Please make a post if it is unsuccessful.

 

If you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in /r/techsupport for further assistance.

 

**Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):**

* Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts.
* Consider enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts!
* Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.

 

**What is malware?**

[Malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. \[Source: Wikipedia.com\]

 

**How did I get infected?**

It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher’s website directly.

 

**How to prevent future infections:**

Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using [Ninite](http://ninite.com) for installing/updating software is very easy & safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.

 

**The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:**

 

**Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:**

* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)
* [BitDefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)
* [ESET Free Online Scanner](http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/)

Free AVs will only go so far. I highly recommend purchasing the AV of your choice to get better protection. Companies who offer products for free are usually making money off you one way or another. This has been [proven again recently with Avast](https://www.cnet.com/news/antivirus-firm-avast-is-reportedly-selling-users-web-browsing-data/). If you use Avast, uninstall it immediately.

As of **[April 2014](http://codepen.io/TheJaredWilcurt/full/hbrCv)** Microsoft is officially **finished supporting** Windows XP.

* * *

* * *

**Why it's important for you to upgrade now**

If you are still using XP, or know of people who are it's time to upgrade them (and yourself)!

Microsoft will no longer be supplying updates and security patches. Those who create infections have been stockpiling XP vulnerabilities for months because if they wait for MS to drop support then they can use them forever, versus infecting machines now with these tricks and Microsoft patching XP to prevent those tricks from working in the future.

Also XP was released in 2001, and has well run it's course, now with 3 consumer operating systems from Microsoft having been released.

New hardware won't support XP, and neither will new software (Office 2013 for example won't run on XP *or* Vista). When Microsoft stops supporting XP, it will be a very short time before everyone else stops as well.

* * *

**What if I use ""X"" software to protect me from infections**

There are a lot of good protection softwares out there. One of the most popular amongst this community is Microsoft Security Essentials, which will also cease working on April 1st, 2014 (for XP machines).

Even if you have great protection software, it's still something that is added on TOP of your operating system, and if there are holes in your OS, infections will still be able to get in. 3rd party companies aren't going to be able to patch all the security issues in XP, and they'll only support XP for as long as there is a market. And it should be noted that XP's market share has been dropping fast and will continue to do so. Don't be one of the stragglers still hanging on past April 1st.

* * *

**Where to go**

Windows Vista, 7, 8, Linux, etc. are all available as upgrade paths. I personally would recommend Windows 7, as it has a good upgrade path from XP and currently has the largest market share of any Operating System. Meaning, much like XP, it will likely have a very long line of support. I figure if you stuck with XP for this long, you'll probably want something you can also stick with for as long as you can.

Other options exist and if you're interested you can discuss them in the comments below. I'll keep some links here for quick access

**How to back up data:**

When upgrading to a new Operating System, it's always best to do a fresh install, so any little bugs don't carry over. This means everything will be wiped clean, so you should back up all the data on your computer that you want to keep. Even if you do an OS Upgrade, there's still a chance your data could be lost (about 1 in 10 from the hundreds I've done for regular household computers). And you should be backing up your data regularly anyways.

The easiest route will likely be to get an external hard drive, copy everything you want to keep over to it, and then unplug the external drive before wiping your computer and installing the new OS.

For more information on data backup see our wiki page:

* [**WIKI:** Different ways of backing up data and keeping it safe:](http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/wiki/hdd#wiki_different_ways_of_backing_up_data_and_keeping_it_safe.3A)

**Compatibility and the difference between 32-Bit and 64-Bit**

If you use older software, it may not be compatible with newer operating systems. This is always the case. Fortunately the vast majority of software that worked on XP will also work on Vista/7/8. So you shouldn't have much to worry about, but if you have any truly ancient software, now is the time to find a replacement.

Something many people are confused about when transitioning from XP to a newer operating system is the difference between 32 and 64-bit. So I'm going to clear it up so you'll understand what is best for you.

* **32-Bit:** This is what computers used for the longest time. Back in the 80's when computers were considered powerful if they had 4 MB of RAM (roughly the size of one MP3), they started using 32-Bit systems. They knew that it would work great for a long time, because it had a max of 4 GB (or 4,096 MB). And it did last for a long time. But we got to a point where we were producing 4GB sticks of RAM relatively cheap and needed to change to something that could see all of the RAM and be able to use it.
* **64-Bit:** This is what we gradually transitioned to from around 2004 to now. It can see below 4GB, just like 32-bit, and above to virtually any RAM amount that will exist in your lifetime (17,592,186,044,416 MB). To put that number in perspective, if each one of those MBs was equal to one second, then that would be roughly 35,000 years. 35,000 years ago was when neanderthals went extinct. So, it's a pretty big number. Which is why we're switching all our computers over to it. The only downside is that since it **is** so different, some programs won't work with it that would work on a 32-bit machine. Again, these are mostly programs from the 1990's, and before, but some newer ones may have issues too. But since we've been doing this 64-Bit thing for about a decade now, you're not as likely to run in to too many issues. So unless you absolutely have to use a program made for Windows 95, and refuse to find a replacement, you should go with 64-Bit to take advantage of having access to more RAM.

* * *

If you have questions regarding upgrading from XP to another OS that still has support, ask them below. This post will be pinned so the community will be here to help those making the switch.

**TLDR:** XP is getting dropped by Microsoft meaning infections will run rampant on it. Back up your data and upgrade to Windows 7, or something else with long term support. Ask for help with the switch in the comments below."

buildapc,"Last Saturday I posted about building a gaming computer for my son for pretty much just Minecraft.  I had $300 to work with.  I expected a few replies and a few pointers.  The response to that post was unbelievable.  I woke up the next day and my wife told me she needed to silence my phone in the middle of the night.  Over 40K views and over 300 replies.  I now know the meaning of RIP inbox.  I got a lot of great advice from a lot of people.  In the end, it was pretty clear.  I could build it for $300, but it wouldn't be great.  It may play Minecraft, but that's about it.  I would be better off spending more money on a build, and well, my wife and I didnt really have more money to put towards it.


Let me start by saying I was messaged by quite a few of you about graphics card, mother boards, processors that they had laying around. Willing to send them to me for nothing, or maybe some shipping.  The generosity of this sub is amazing.  I was never looking for anything but advice, and many of you offered many things.  For that I am very grateful.


Then I was messaged by a member of this sub who wishes to remain anonymous.  They offered to purchase a WHOLE BUILD for me.  They said they were around my son's age when they got into building computers and technology.  They now work with computers as their profession and wish they could have shared a similar experience with their dad growing up.   I was skeptical to say the least, but they were very genuine in their message and honestly I don't know how I could have said no.

Over the next few days we sent messages back and forth and he put together a build for my son and I.  My wife kept telling me its crazy and someone was messing with me.  I stayed a little skeptical but I could tell through the conversations we had that this person was truly a good person looking to make a positive impact.

As of last night, all the parts were ordered and are being shipped straight to my house.  They have sent me order confirmations as well as tracking on all the parts for the build from Amazon and Newegg.

Here is the build:

All I can say is that it is truly a Christmas miracle. 

I have never been so moved by the generosity of one person before.  I am in shock and words cannot describe the excitement I have to build this amazing computer with my son. 

I do not think I will ever be able to thank this person enough for what they have done.  All they asked in return is to pay it forward.  And believe me I will!

I will be sure to update when the build is completed!  

Merry Christmas everyone!  

TLDR: Wanted to build with my son.  Didn't have a budget that was good.  A stranger on the internet sent me $1300+ of parts to build with my son.  I still am in shock.

Edit:Spelling

Edit2: Wow. Thank you for the gold.  This community is gold. Thank you so much to everyone here.  This has been an amazing few days!  Also RIP inbox again lol


UPDATE: The Build is Complete! https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7mqw43/my_son_and_i_finished_the_build_that_an_anonymous/

buildapc,"It's not perfect, and there have been a number of times that I haven't been able to find a specific part(that I know exists but they don't have it in their database), but it's a wonderful tool that has saved all of us an unimaginable amount of time in the building process. 

I mean, imagine a world without it.

You have to double and triple check all compatibilities, look through all the different retailers for the lowest prices, write down build lists yourself. Calculate the TDP, make sure your graphics card isn't too long and your CPU cooler isn't too tall.

They do all of this for you and more. They let you store multiple lists and post finished builds. And you have all of that saved online where you can access it anywhere.

Best yet, I heard they're working on a website overhaul to make mobile use more fluid.

I want everybody who sees this to take a moment to remember how valuable PCPartPicker has been to all of us. For free. Because they believe in the cause.

Edit: of course they make their money somehow, but they don't charge us for their services

buildapc,"I bought 2 copies of Windows 10 Home OEM from Newegg.com for $85 each on sale.  This is consistent with genuine OEM pricing around $100.  They emailed me two copy/pasted keys.  Both failed to activate Windows so I called Microsoft.  They checked the keys and said both were pirated!  This is not a genuine Microsoft product!

I contacted Newegg.com and was transferred to a supervisor.  They refused to replace the keys with verifiably genuine Microsoft products and refused a refund.  They did offer to email me more pirated keys(they called them digital but could offer no evidence they were anything other than what Microsoft said). They refused to acknowledge that Microsoft confirmed Newegg.com’s keys were pirated, constantly trying to say things like, “I’m sorry you weren’t able to get your keys to work” or, “I can assure you that all of our keys are genuine, but they don’t always work.”   Fact check;  Microsoft has already confirmed these were pirated keys.  As for them not always working?  49% of Newegg’s reviews for this item are 1 Star...nearly all of them saying the same thing...the keys don’t work and Microsoft says they are no good.  Wish I’d noticed that before I bought...which is why I am here, actually.  Don’t make the same mistake as me.  I’ll be disputing the credit card charges and I’m optimistic since Microsoft has my back, but what a hassle!

By the way, I just bought a ton of hardware from Newegg that works fine.  If it didn’t, I’d be in trouble because they are notorious for not RMAing bad components, but everything I bought was stuff I’d be comfortable taking straight to the manufacturers.  7 dead pixel minimum to return a monitor!? Sometimes the deals aren’t worth dealing with a company like this.  Definitely not the place to buy software or easily counterfeit goods.

TLDR; Don’t buy software from Newegg.com.  They sold me pirated windows keys that don’t work and refuse to replace them with genuine products or issue a refund.

buildapc,"#Guide to Setting up Windows 10 & Maintaining your PC ^^Updated ^^4/22/2020

This is assuming you have successfully completed your PC build and are wondering what to do next. Here’s a few helpful tips I have learned over the years. 

**Warning:** Yee who don't like opinions, probably don't dare enter..

&nbsp;

**Windows Installation:**

Download [Windows Media Creation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10). Create a USB installation drive using the tool and boot to the drive by changing boot order in your motherboard UEIF/BIOS.

Start the install, choose “Customize Settings” and turn everything on this screen off. Proceed to install Windows with a local account. If you're okay with Microsoft collecting some data, you can always sync your Windows account later in **Settings > Accounts**. The benefit being Windows will backup your settings and can sync them with other PCs you own. 

Once you boot up, head over to **Settings > Update and Security**. Check for updates and go grab your favorite beverage and let it complete, you may reboot multiple times during this step.

Once you're done updating, go to **Start > Settings > Privacy** and go down [the list on the left](https://i.imgur.com/FZ8TqkW.png) and turn everything off unless you actually use it. 

* Same goes for background apps -- only disable apps from running in the background that you don't want notifications from. It's safe to disable background apps completely if you don't care.

* Under ""Feedback & Diagnostics"" switch that to ""Basic"". Once that is done, head to **Settings > Update and Security > Advanced Options > Delivery Optimization** and turn it off. That setting allows P2P updates across your network which is a potential security risk.

* Next head over to **Settings > Network and Internet > Wi-Fi** and turn everything off here besides the Wi-Fi itself. 

Having done all of that correctly, you have disabled the bulk of data logging, background app usage and diagnostic feedback. Yay! Windows is installed. Much of what you do next is personal preference (appearance, software, customization) but there are a few things I would like to recommend.

&nbsp;

***

**Quick accessibility tip - Open Control Panel and at the top-right change ""View by:"" to ""Small icons"". It will make more sense following this guide.** 

***

&nbsp;

**Update motherboard BIOS** - If everything is working properly, and you are happy with the performance of your PC - It is generally not recommended to update the BIOS as there is always the potential for something to go wrong. That being said, if you follow the installation instructions **exactly** from your MOBO manufacturer, you will be fine. 

* For all BIOS and firmware updates, I will refer you to your manufacturer’s support page to ensure you are getting the latest and greatest. Follow the instructions there for how to install (typically downloading the update to a FAT 32 USB drive and flashing the update in your UEIF/BIOS). 

&nbsp;

**Drivers:** Windows 10 will automatically update and install drivers for your hardware via Windows Update. This is typically fine for everything except your GPU and chipset, which we will take care of next. 

&nbsp;

**Update your graphics card driver** – Again, head over to your manufacturer’s website and follow the instructions there to install:

AMD - [http://support.amd.com/en-us/download](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download)

NVIDIA - [http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

&nbsp;

**Update your chipset drivers:** - Chipset drivers are a set of operating instructions which tells your CPU how to behave and interact within your PC. Typically these will come with a optimized power plan for your CPU which you can enable in Control Panel > Power Options. 

AMD - [http://support.amd.com/en-us/download](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download)

Intel - https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005533/software.html

&nbsp;

At this point it may be a good idea to grab [HWiNFO64](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/) (also in the Additional Tools section below) to check the internal temperatures of your CPU, GPU, etc.. to make sure nothing looks out of the ordinary. If anything appears abnormal you can try reapplying the thermal paste to make sure you have adequate coverage. 

As far as where temperatures should be. That will differ drastically depending on your cooling solution (air, water, AIO, passive), ambient temperatures, overall case airflow and cooling performance of individual hardware. Generally if you are idling and your CPU/GPU is near or under 45°-50° you are likely doing just fine. 

&nbsp;

You can also test your ram by using Windows Memory Diagnostic. Just type **Windows Memory Diagnostic** in to Windows search and it will come up. You will be required to restart your PC to test. When you are done, head to **Event Viewer > Windows Logs > System** and the results should be the most recent log (at the top). If it's not, filter for Event ID 1201. 

&nbsp;

**Change refresh rate on monitor** - If you have a 144hz or 120hz monitor, and either a DisplayPort, HDMI 2.0, or DVI-D (Dual-Link) connection, it’s a good time to look at your refresh rates. If you own an Nvidia card, change it in Nvidia control panel. For an AMD card, follow these steps:

* Right-click your desktop and choose Display settings
* Scroll down and select Display adapter properties
* In the properties window click on List All Modes
* Scroll down and choose your desired mode (e.g. 144hz) and apply

**Note:** If you have more than one monitor you will need to select the other monitor in windows display and repeat steps above. 

&nbsp;

***

**Edit:** Ehh.. Thinking back I would just ignore this part. The firmware your drives ship with are just fine. It's not worth it, just leave it alone. 

~~**Update your SSD firmware** - This may be a new concept to those coming from an HDD but your SSD’s firmware can be updated as well. To begin, head over to your manufacturer’s support page (yes again) and to ensure things go smoothly, I recommend downloading their management software. If you just purchased your SSD, you will more than likely find it is already updated. They are not frequent so if you're not concerned, feel free to skip this step.~~

~~• Crucial offers their “Storage Executive Management software”, and Samsung has “Samsung Magician”. If you own a different SSD search its support page and see what they offer.~~

~~• Crucial offers a “Momentum Cache” feature which speeds up your drive at the expense of using RAM and the potential for data loss. I go into more depth on it [in a previous post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7mf8yo/reminder_your_ssds_firmware_can_be_updated/). Personally, I’d leave it disabled if you’re happy with its performance and your workload doesn't demand it. For normal gaming and office use you won't notice a difference. Samsung offers a similar feature called ""Rapid"" and while I have not used it personally, I would say my opinion on it stands.~~

~~**Warning:** Some manufacturers may format when upgrading. *Please* **READ** the instructions carefully. I am not responsible for any data loss.~~

**Anti-virus/malware:** 

This can be a polarizing subject for some, and I can only offer my experience, but after years of searching and experimenting this is what works for me. I will also preface this by saying, depending on your browsing/download habits this can change entirely. Ultimately, my best advice on the subject is: 

#Do your research and find what works best for you.


That being said, I use the following and it's all available for free… 


**Anti-Virus:** Windows Defender – For me, Windows Defender is good enough. It’s simple, and FREE. Stay vigilant and let it run on its schedule scans and build its definitions, scan periodically if you wish.

**Anti-Malware:** Malwarebytes Free/uBlock Origin – Again, the free version of Malwarebytes is good enough for me. While browsing, uBlock will do the bulk of your malware blocking and if you suspect anything got by, run a Malwarebytes scan. I run Malwarebytes every couple of weeks personally for peace of mind.

**Firewall:** Windows Firewall. While behind a router there isn't much use for a soft Firewall, it is good for protecting yourself within your own network. E.g. if another PC on your network gets infected, it could prevent your device from contracting the virus/malware. It is also useful to create outbound rules for preventing certain applications from accessing the internet if you don't want them too. 

&nbsp;

**Additional Plug-ins for safer browsing:**

* [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) - Privacy Badger stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web.

* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - HTTPS everywhere rewrites all web requests to use HTTPS wherever possible. 

* [NoScript](https://noscript.net/) - NoScript is an open source add-on that allows JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins to be executed only by trusted web sites of your choice (e.g. your online bank).

&nbsp;

**Additional configuration:**

Malwarebytes:

* Go into the settings and enable “Scan for rootkits”.

uBlock Origin:

* The default settings will block 99% of ads and malware, but if you want more protection/AD blocking/annoyances filtering, head over to **uBlock settings > 3rd party filters**. I enabled all uBlock filters (except Experimental), all “Ads” filters (except mobile), all “Privacy” filters, all “Malware Domains” filters and all “Annoyances” filters. 

I’ve never had any issues browsing or viewing content while using these settings, but to each their own.  If you have issues you can always reset to default on the settings home page. There is said to be a drop in performance if you are doubling up on items in your lists, but if there is it's negligible and I haven't noticed any. Other than that, the worse that can happen is that you increase the chance of rendering a page incorrectly. Not a bad trade off for peace of mind while browsing.

&nbsp;

***

**Performance Monitor:**

Windows should be mostly configured at this point. I'd recommend running this report to see if Windows detects any issues or has any suggestions about your current setup. If you receive passing grades on everything, pat yourself on the back. If you received a fail or warning, don't panic, just read the suggestion and follow the instructions on how to resolve it:

1. Open a 'RUN window' by pressing the 'Windows key + R'
2. Type **perfmon /report** and hit Run
3. Wait and check your results

&nbsp;

I like to routinely check **Reliability Monitor** just to see how my system is doing day to day. It will report any critical errors or update failures so you can, well... see how ""reliable"" your system is. If you go 5 days without any critical errors reported than congratulations you have a very healthy system. Also, keep in mind the extent of the error reported. If Malwarebytes crashing shows up as a critical error or crash, I don't think that's a good representation of your system health. Some stuff is unavoidable, Windows isn't near perfect. 

Along with Reliability Monitor, keep an eye on **Event Viewer** to track any errors you may come across. It should be your first step in troubleshooting issues. Ignore any ""DistributedCOM"" errors. They've been around since Windows 8 and everyone gets them, they're harmless. 

&nbsp;

**CPU Overclocking:**

There is a huge community behind overclocking, and while it can be fun to eek out extra scores in benchmarks, it honestly isn't worth the hassle of the average PC user. On modern Ryzen and Intel chips, algorithms have been built into account for this and will automatically clock frequencies up and down depending on thermal performance. If you bought a CPU in 2018 or later, my opinion would be to just let it do it's thing. 

&nbsp;

**XMP Profile / Overclocking RAM**

Enable your XMP profile in BIOS so your RAM can run at its rated speed. There are too many different boards and ways to do this, so just type your ""motherboard name + XMP Profile"" into Google to see how to do it.

***

**Maintenance/Upkeep:** 

Windows Disk Cleanup. Nothing against CCleaner, but it's unnecessary and deletes valuable Windows Defender files. Also, it comes with a registry cleaner which **shouldn't be used for any reason.** 

Realistically, if you're not pressed on hard drive space or experiencing issues, there is no reason to run a cleaner of any kind. If you run Windows Disk Cleanup just understand what you are cleaning before you check mark it for deletion. 

&nbsp;

**Registry:**

Your registry is essentially a Windows database that informs your operating system and applications how to behave and appear. That being said,  **Don't use registry cleaners**. While CCleaner is harmless when used correctly, messing with your registry always creates the potential for harm. You will never see any measurable performance increase from using a registry cleaner.

If you know what you are doing, the registry is a fantastic tool for making UI or OS changes (e.g. removing the ""3D objects folder from File Explorer, removing OneDrive, etc...). As always, just make a backup first.

&nbsp;

**Defragging your HDD** - Probably don't need to do this often, once every month or so, or after very large frequent file writes. FYI, Windows automatically sets a schedule to defrag your HDD every week by default.  To change the schedule or run it manually, go into **""My PC"" > Right-click your HDD > Properties > Tools > Defragment**. Analyze the drive and if it's over 10-15% fragmented, considered running the defrag.

**Do NOT use third party tools to defrag your SSD.**

**Note:** The native Windows 10 defragger is smart enough to know this, it won't give you the option if you try. Instead, what you will find is that Windows does a version of defragging once a month by default called 'Optimizing'. You can read a really good article about it [here](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheRealAndCompleteStoryDoesWindowsDefragmentYourSSD.aspx). In short, don't worry and let Windows do its thing. 

&nbsp;

**Backup:** 

I use Windows Backup and Restore. I'm sure there are more comprehensive tools out there, some 3rd party ones which were suggested below, but there really isn't anything more comprehensive than creating a system image. You can do this by navigating to **Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > Backup and Restore (Windows 7)**. Once I have set up Windows to my liking I create a system image and store it on an external drive or a secondary HDD, preferably both. Do it periodically if you have the space. You will thank yourself if you ever run into an issue and need to restore from an image. 

You can also use the Full or Incremental backup feature, but I prefer just to have a system image on hand in case of a failure. Backup all of your important files and documents to the cloud so they are safe from system coruption and accessible across your devices. Google Drive is a great tool. 

* A system image is an exact copy, or clone, of your drive in that particular state when you created it. You can use it to restore the system after a catastrophic crash, hard disk failure, etc...

* A Full Backup contains data files, but not everything on the disk. You cannot use it to restore the system.

&nbsp;

**System Restore:** 

Go to **Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > System > System Protection**. Chose your C: drive and click ""Configure..."". Turn on system protection and choose a percentage of space you have to spare. 5% is typically more than enough. Use this option if you ever have an issue and need to restore to a particular point in time - before a faulty Windows update for instance. 

&nbsp;

**UPS:** 

If you can afford to buy one, buy one. For those who don't know what they are, UPS stands for Uninterruptible Power Supply. I own two APC models I got from Amazon and living in Florida, they've saved my ass during many o' thunderstorms, power outages, brownouts and surges. Keeping a steady flow of electricity to my PC, it's good peace of mind to have. 

If you are wondering, it is okay to plug a UPS into a quality surge protector like the Tripp Lite Isobar 2, home UPS devices typically don't have high joule ratings (surge protection).

**Physical Maintenance:** 

I'm sure everyone has their own routine for this step, and depending on where your PC is located it may require more frequent cleaning/dusting. Always keep pressurized air (duster) handy. Once every few months or whenever you notice a dust build-up, open it up and blast it. **Hold your fans in place so you are not spinning the blades, this can generate an electrical current and potentially damage your circuit headers**. I would avoid using any sort of vacuum attachments as there is a good risk of damaging your components. For tempered glass, use a microfiber cloth to buff out any smudges. Glass cleaners are safe to use on tempered glass, but I would still dilute them so your mixture is half-water, half-cleaner. Other than that, find a nice cool place with good airflow to keep your machine running smoothly.

**Extras (optional steps):**

**Calibrate monitors** – Windows has a color calibration tool built-in. Or if you’re lucky enough you will find a guide for your specific monitor. Just do a Google search for “Calibrate + Your monitor model” and see what kind of information is out there. Tom’s Hardware had a good one for my AOC and I have noticed more defined colors since doing it.  

**Enable High Performance power plan** - Go to Control Panel > Power Options and choose the ""High Performance"" plan. 

**Disable “Enhance pointer precision”** – Go to Control Panel > Mouse > Pointer options and uncheck “Enhance pointer precision”. This will give you more control over your mouse while gaming. You can read more on it [here]( http://www.thewindowsclub.com/enhance-pointer-precision-windows).

**[Disable Cortana](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/features/how-to-disable-cortana-on-windows-10-1683223)** – I don’t know who uses Cortana, but it annoys the hell out of me. 

**[Disable OneDrive](https://www.howtogeek.com/225973/how-to-disable-onedrive-and-remove-it-from-file-explorer-on-windows-10/)** - Only if you don't use it, I prefer Google Drive. 

**[Disable Fast start up](https://www.howtogeek.com/243901/the-pros-and-cons-of-windows-10s-fast-startup-mode/)** - If you have an SSD, disable this. It will not affect restarting your PC, but when doing a shutdown it will not reinitialize drivers meaning any driver related issue you were having before your shutdown, will persist when booting up the next time. u/agent268 has a very informative [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/4x7n41/psa_disable_fast_startup_to_force_windows_to_load/d6dghtm/) on it. 

**Disable Remote Connections**  - Go to Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > System > Remote settings and uncheck ""Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer"". Below that select ""Don't allow remote connections to this computer"" if you are not remoting in to it.  

**Turn on Dark mode** - Right-click your Desktop and select ""Personalize"". Select ""Colors"" on the left, scroll to the bottom and select dark. [Makes it much easier on the eyes](https://i.imgur.com/zqTFowh.png).

I'm not going to include information on going buck wild disabling services and data logging because what I mentioned above is sufficient for me, but if you feel inclined you can search yourself and find some good posts on the subject. I don't recommend using the SpyBot tools because they modify system values and if you're going to do that, you should learn what you're doing and modify it yourself in case something goes wrong. In a recent Windows update they provided the ability to delete your stored diagnostic data in Settings > Privacy > Diagnostics & feedback > Scroll down to ""Delete diagnostic data"", just take it with a grain of salt as to what actually gets deleted. If you've stuck around this long, I love you."

**WOAH.** [danketiquette](https://www.reddit.com/user/danketiquette) gave me *Reddit Gold* over this. And to think I had heartbeats over the 20 replies and 150 points on my thread alone. You are my hero man, I haven't felt this happy over being handed a banana since ever. Somewhere between a state of shock and bliss now. I don't even know what Reddit gold does but thank you so much man.

Some points of interest:

Don't bother fanboying over your favourite distro too hard. It won't take long before the next Linux device enters your household and decides to mess with your head by supporting every distro under the sun *except* your favourite one. Think about it this way: Having access to multiple distributions, all catered to different situations, is *way* more of a feature than any Windows system could ever hope to achieve.

No seriously Arch fanboys it's time to calm down, I love Arch as much as the next basement dweller but if you stare blindly into the light all it will do is burn out your eyes. What would you do if Arch suddenly disappeared? Install Void Linux and cry on their forums how everything isn't Arch? Like Windows users do on Linux forums? Because they are stuck in their ways? Notice a pattern? Man I talk in too many condescending questions.

The only reason I mentioned Emacs over Vim is because Emacs has superior support in graphical environments, sorry Vim fanboys. Again in 2018 it really won't matter that much because both have large enough bases of support. Whichever gets the job done in the *best way possible for you* is the one you should go for. You should be enhancing your workflow in whatever way is productive to you.

**Okay back to mindless bullet listing:**

* Ever seen the [Android root folder?](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LsRUE.png) Obviously you'll need to be rooted to access it, but once you are [you can use any file explorer with root access](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx&hl=en) to browse through it.

[There's NFS too](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NFS) but people will shout at you for using an non-encrypted protocol.

Working on an update but I'm too busy being a retard on the internet right now. Coming soon I suppose. Valve time though."
linux4noobs,"With alarming frequency I see posts on this subreddit involving relatively basic troubleshooting questions from users running Kali Linux. I wrote this as a response to that. I think Kali Linux is great. I just don't think everybody should be using it as a desktop OS.

**The TL;DR for this post could be taken straight from the [Kali FAQ](http://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux)**: ""If you are unfamiliar with Linux generally, if you do not have at least a basic level of competence in administering a system, if you are looking for a Linux distribution to use as a learning tool to get to know your way around Linux, or if you want a distro that you can use as a general purpose desktop installation, Kali Linux is probably not what you are looking for.""

*Dear Linux noobs,*

Linux is cool. You're interested in Linux and that makes you cool too. You should be proud of your interest in Linux. You're now part of a community that is full of cool people (OK, a few of us are jerks, but what can you do).

What else is cool? Computer hacking. Password cracking. Network penetration. These things are neat, and the people who can do them are usually pretty cool too (though some of them are jerks too). Learning to do these things is fun, and if you want to do it, you should. When practiced responsibly, these things can make fun hobbies, or even a lucrative career. The purpose of this post is not to discourage anybody from learning to do these things.

One of the major problems new Linux users face when starting out is figuring out which Linux distribution is right for them. There are a lot of options after all. Everybody likes to recommend their favorite distro (and also occasionally give their opinion on their least favorite distro). Very frequently I see questions in this subreddit, and in related subreddits, like ""What distro should I use?"", ""I want to learn to code, what distro would be good for me?"", ""What is the best distro for python programming?"", or ""What distro should I use to learn penetration testing?"". New Linux users who might be interested in penetration testing (or some other related topic) might, by some means or another, discover Kali Linux. They might think ""Hey, I want to learn Linux and also pen-testing! I should use Kali Linux."" They'd probably be wrong.

The thing is, most desktop distributions provide access to the same software. If you want to watch Youtube videos and write email, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, etc, are all equally capable of that. If you want to learn python programming, you can do that on any of those distributions. Similarly, if you want to learn pen-testing, you can do it from any of those distributions.

Kali Linux is a distribution specifically designed to be a toolkit for professional pen-testers. As such, it might be very attractive to new Linux users who are interested in security. However, Kali is /not/ designed as a general purpose Linux distro. Some elements of it's design are simply not suited for use as a general purpose desktop. If you're a new Linux user who installs Kali Linux chances are you will have a frustrating experience. The Kali Linux maintainers even have a FAQ page ""Is Kali Linux right for me?"" 

http://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux

Please read that article before deciding to use Kali as a desktop OS, especially if you're new to Linux. If you don't yet understand some of the points made in that article that's probably a sign to avoid Kali for now.

It's quite often that I see people asking questions like ""How do I do X in Kali Linux?"" or ""[Kali] Y is not working. Please help."" Unfortunately these users don't usually get the help they need, which makes me sad. The posts are often dismissed or downvoted. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'd wager that most of the people asking these questions don't need Kali. They need a desktop distribution.

I am worried that if your first adventures with Linux are in Kali you will have a frustrating experience and be turned off from the whole endeavor. Your questions might be dismissed and left unanswered because you appear to be in over your head.

*Using Kali Linux as your first desktop Linux distro is like learning to drive on a racecar. Please don't do it.*

pcgamingtechsupport," How  do I check if Riot's Vanguard client is completely uninstalled? Not  wanting to play the game enough to risk something like this... it gets kernel level privileges and runs all the time. Battle eye and other AC only run when the game is running. The service is stopped otherwise.

During  installation it said it was installing it and before valorant finished  installing I stopped it. I then went to add remove programs and clicked uninstall for Valorant and the separate anti cheat program, Vanguard. Is there a way to check if the  process is running?

Here is a description of the program that gets installed when you first install Valorant:

[https://www.techspot.com/news/84841-valorant-anti-cheat-software-loads-kernel-based-driver.html](https://www.techspot.com/news/84841-valorant-anti-cheat-software-loads-kernel-based-driver.html)"
pcgamingtechsupport,"**Update (20 July):** *I have learned of an alternate solution to fix this problem, which does not require having to download anything and does not appear to cause problems with any other games (e.g. BioShock). As of now I believe this should be the preferred solution. See ""Option #1"" below for the update.*

&nbsp;

**tl;dr:** The ""Games Explorer"" hub in Windows 7 and Vista is preventing older PC games from launching. Check the list of symptoms below. You can fix it by making a single change in your Windows registry - see Option #1.

&nbsp;

In the last few weeks, Microsoft shut down servers related to the [Games Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_for_Windows#Games_Explorer) feature in Windows 7 and Vista (possibly related to the end-of-life [announcement](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/farewell-to-microsoft-internet-games-on-windows-xp/035d5144-6c1b-49bb-b3d5-37f6355fec39) for the integrated Internet Games service). As a result, there are a *ton* of older PC games that will not run anymore on those operating systems.

When you launch one of these games, the **gameux.dll** file in Windows' System32 or SysWOW64 directory tries to contact Microsoft's servers in order to update the game's profile in Games Explorer. The game will not start until the profile update is complete. Since the relevant servers are offline now, the update will never happen.

This problem affects hundreds of popular games. In my testing I have found titles that were released from 1998 through 2006.

&nbsp;

The symptoms of this problem are:

- The game window does not appear after launching it, but the game's executable does not crash and there is no error message. 

  (*If you ARE getting an error message, then you have an unrelated problem and these solutions will not fix it.*)

- When you launch the game, a **rundll32.exe** process is started and visible in Task Manager, which is using about 8 MB of RAM and also appears to be frozen.
- If you add the Command Line column to Task Manager, you can see that the target of rundll32.exe is *C:\Windows\System32\gameux.dll* or *C:\Windows\SysWOW64\gameux.dll*

&nbsp;

There are two ways to fix this:

&nbsp;

**Option #1 (recommended)**

The best solution I know of is to modify the Windows registry so that Games Explorer points to a [loopback address](https://www.lifewire.com/network-computer-special-ip-address-818385) - meaning your own computer - instead of Microsoft's servers. I found this solution on GOG's troubleshooting [page](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025926714), who grabbed it from a user in their [forums](https://www.gog.com/forum/general/old_games_not_launching_and_eating_100_of_the_cpu_on_windows_7/page1).

Here are the steps to take:

- Open the Registry Editor. You can find it by searching for ""Registry Editor"" (without quotes) in the Start Menu.
- In the left side of the Registry Editor, navigate to the following folder:

    *Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\GameUX\ServiceLocation*

- Create a backup by right-clicking the *ServiceLocation* folder and selecting *Export*.

    Give it a name like ""Games Explorer backup"" (without quotes) and save it somewhere on your hard drive, in case you need to undo the changes.

- Now in the right side of the Registry Editor, right-click *Games* and select *Modify*.
- In the *Value Data* box, delete the current entry and replace it with *127.0.0.1*
- Then click *OK* and close the Registry Editor.
- You may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

&nbsp;

**Option #2**

If Option #1 doesn't work or you'd rather not modify the Windows registry, you can simply disable both of the gameux.dll files instead.

The gameux.dll files are only used for Games Explorer, so disabling them is completely safe. Someone created a batch file in 2012 that will do this easily, and it is reversible by running the file again.

There is at least one game - the original version of BioShock - that won't run if gameux.dll is disabled, so re-enabling the files may be necessary.

I did not find any other other games with this requirement after spending a few hours testing and searching the internet, but if you happen to come across any, please leave a comment to let me know (launching the game should give you an error message that says ""*Failed to create the GameExplorer object*"" or something similar).

[This is the blog post](http://ubeogesh-things.blogspot.com/2012/08/resolve-it-finally-game-explorer-aka.html) that has the needed file (download link is about 2/3 of the way down).

[Mirror](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OW4ogjIBOVQsVAA9F5piZLjkyY34pqte) (Google Drive)

- Extract **GameUxFixed-Ubeogesh.bat** from the archive to a temporary folder.
- Run it, then press any key to apply the patch. If you get an error message about not having ownership privileges, run it again by right-clicking and selecting ""*Run as administrator.*""
- You might need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
- Run the .bat file again to undo the changes, if necessary.

[This post](https://superuser.com/questions/1075848/why-does-windows-games-explorer-attempt-to-access-the-internet-whenever-i-laun) on superuser.com was particularly helpful for me, and I also learned that this has been an issue with Windows since at least [April 2010](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-gaming/windows-7-game-explorer-interfering-with-game/efd39c74-cfab-4c2c-b6c5-834b8849a1b3).

I’m struggling on every game from 2005 and up to get even 60 FPS. Considering my specs, I have no idea why this is happening. I’ve just built this computer and all systems check out okay. Installed all the drivers. My specs are way above any of the recommendations for the games I’m attempting to play. Any help is appreciated!"

It has 2 bootable drives in it, both known good. 


I haven’t been able to test myself, but my brother has done the following without success


- Changed only RAM module to a different slot 
- changed GPU to different slot
- plugged and unplugged PSU cables into GPU
- tried to get video from all HDMI ports, 2 from GPU, 1 from MB 


GPU fans don’t run, although from what I’ve read, it could be by default from GPU to not run fans until cooling is necessary.

Everything is stock, didn’t try overclocking and when it failed it was just downloading a steam game at a throttled 8Mbps. Nothing running in the background or anything. 

It’s just like when I hadn’t updated the bios, same thing. No video, no tones, nothing.

all the LEDs working like they always did when it was ok.

Any clues on what to do next would be appreciated.

EDIT: booted with GPU completely off, no change. 

Checked RAM on a different computer and doesn’t work. Does that mean its either CPU or MB problem?


**solution** 

Checked that all connections were tight, pushed in ram all the way in and reset the MB by removing the coin cell battery, and it all worked"

&nbsp;

**Preambel**

&nbsp;

Dear reddit - I'm really frustrated since the powerhouse that I built myself still isn't working properly. Let me preface the current situation by mentioning me having a lot of bad luck (had a CPU that was dead on arrival, a faulty Motherboard etc.) and ongoing problems with my PC, therefore naming him ""Beast"" since he seems to be unruly as fuck.

I built this rig back in march and after sorting out all the faulty hardware I, for whatever reason, got when buying all my shit the rig ran fine for a few weeks, but then blue screens started to appear. Not one, but many. The PC crashes every time whether before the Windows Startup screen or right when I entered my password and it's checking if it's valid. It then stopped for a few weeks, and re-appeared. This kept going on over the year but I was always like ""give 'em a bit of time, don't be too pushy"" and lo behold - at some point he ran fine.

Only to now start messing with me again.. but I'm fed up, really. I since started studying VFX / 3D Animation and need this workstation working properly whenever I need it to. So please, if you could help me that'd be wonderful.

I googled the shit out of all those error messages but all I get is ""deinstall third party software"".. thing is; the problem existed before installing anything other than Windows, too. I also reinstalled Windows a couple of times. Still the same.

&nbsp;

**Issue**

&nbsp;

Keeps crashing and having blue screens with different error codes. The rig starts in safe mode, though. This problem is not reproducable since the rig kind of decides when to mess up itself.

&nbsp;

**Error-Codes:**

&nbsp;

IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL 
&nbsp;

PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA
&nbsp;

 KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED 
&nbsp;

SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION 
&nbsp;

KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE

&nbsp;

**Attempts to Fix the Problem**

&nbsp;

1. I re-installed Windows multiple times - the problem still occurred.
2. I tried to pin down every bit of bloat-ware that could've come with the hardware pre-installed (looking at you ASUS and their fucking Nahimic Service)
3. Stress-tested CPU and RAM. Both work fine.
4. I checked every cable and pin multiple times on their correct position.

Please, please, please - if you could help me sort this out I'd be forever in your debt. I just want to have a powerful workstation that's running properly!

Thanks in advance,
Kafqa."
pcgamingtechsupport,"I think I may have finally gone off the deep end with these 2080ti cards and EVGA.      

I'm going to try to keep this short, but please forgive me if I write too much.     



I get a 2080ti 6/7 months ago. 1 dead fan. RMA it.      

2nd card works great for 6/7 months.      

Both of these cards came in brand new, retail packaging.      

2nd card had a random 'flicker' that was different than a standard black screen, it was a broken up image.      

\-Existed since the beginning but was getting worse.     

RMA 2nd card about a month ago.     

\-Queue insanity origins-       

3rd card arrives and lasts 8 days. Artifacts.      

4th card arrives and lasts 14 days. Artifacts.       

Multiple support threads all over. Mixed opinions, GPU and others PSU.     

Replace my PSU and install 5th card. Lasts 1-2 days then starts crashing. Event ID 13.       

Investigate and find nearly 20,000 Event ID 13 logs from exact date of 3rd card arrival.    

100-200 of these logs would generate every time the game artifacted/froze and needed reboot.      

The other two actually artifacted but this one did not and still has not.      

I make an acronis back up image, reset all CPU/memory O/C (stable for 1.5+ years) get a brand new O/S installed, get all updates and DDU nvidia drivers on a fresh O/S to be extremely safe, especially concerning Windows Update and blocked internet upon reboot.       

As soon as nvidia drivers installed, black screen. Reboot. Red screen of death after Windows login screen.     

Windows 10 Red Screen of Death. That's new.... google results in, 'check oc' 'bad gpu' 'bad factory oc' etc etc.     

Underclock core/memory by a few hundred and oh wow, everything is back to normal. Maybe EVGA did bad OC, no wories, I'll just go fully insane and keep this card underclocked.       

Maybe 20-30 minutes of Division 2 and same issues again.      



Frustrated, restore Acronis image and game on HD 630, onboard GPU built into 7700k CPU.       

Hours and hours go by. Run a Heaven benchmark for 5 hours, all good.     

Put in a GTX 1050 that was used previously around 3rd/4th card as a backup GPU. Again, Division 2 and Heaven pass several hour points with ZERO issues.      

Lose my shit at 'nuclear option' version 2 suggestion. They suggest to re-do all O/S and factory oc, etc etc.      

Also suggest that my UPS, battery backup that's been running for over a year, may be an issue.       

Buy a brand new RX 580 from Amazon PrimeNow. Play Division 2 for 3 hours. Follow up with a 6 hour long benchmark in Heaven. Everything is still going strong.      



So I don't understand how 3 different GPU can work in the same exact hardware, setup, cables, everything... but still somehow... my computer is the issue. Oh no.. my O/S is the issue.. Oh no.. my PSU is the issue.. Oh no.. my UPS battery back up is the issue..      



I would be more inclined to believe them if this was a new/recent 2080ti purchase but no... the 2nd replacement they sent me worked for 6/7 months. It was RMAd for a stupid rare flicker. THEY DIDNT EVEN FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT! I've actually requested it back as at this point, flickering is much better than this nightmare.      



My question is, have I missed something crucial? How the fuck could 3 different GPU work with the same exact setup? How could this seriously be anything other than EVGA cucking me around with 3 refurbished units instead of a brand new one for a $1250 product I purchased new? Am I just fucking insane?"

THAnk you everyone for the help! 

I appreciate all the help.... I'll have another post here when everything is updated software wise in a few days."
pcgamingtechsupport,"I sold my delidded i7-7700K online, and wrote five pages (1700 words) worth of instructions to the person who purchased it, with several links to guides and video tutorials that he could follow.

For practical reasons, I never resealed the processor, and shipped it along with the remaining Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut that I'd used. I specifically told the buyer that if it weren't enough to cover the die and the inside of the IHS (a third-party 100% copper one that I also included in his order), he'd have to buy additional liquid metal, for proper coverage.

Apparently, my warnings didn’t suffice, as he claimed that there was insufficient liquid metal, and not only YOLO'd it on the die alone, but also ran a bunch of games without even checking the temperatures of the cores using HWiNFO64, as I had suggested (a 3-5C difference between cores if fine - 8-10C or more is not fine). ~~Now, he's telling me that only 2c/4t are showing up in Task Manager and CPU-Z.~~

~~Did he fry the remaining cores/threads? The processor shows up correctly in his BIOS (Asus Prime B250M mobo - which revision is a mystery to me), and I already ran him through the msconfig settings (""Normal startup"" and unchecked ""Number of processors"" under Boot Advanced Options).~~

~~What else is there to do? He said his BIOS is updated to the latest version, and he also reset it to its factory settings.~~

**UPDATE:** He followed my msconfig/BIOS instructions once more (correctly, this time) and all 4c/8t are now showing up. However, his idle temps are concerning me. [This is what they look like](https://i.ibb.co/HV6ppHs/temps.png).

I feel like he should take the processor out and apply the liquid metal again (on both the die *and* the IHS, as I made perfectly clear from the beginning), but I'm afraid he may screw up things even more, somehow. What do you all think? He only cares about gaming.

**UPDATE #2:** Thanks for the answers, everyone. I did my best in instructing him prior to the sale, going as far as saying that he didn't seem to be the ideal candidate for handling a delidded CPU, and should stick to factory sealed ones, instead. He still went ahead with the purchase.

Now, after helping the buyer fix the lacking cores/threads issue, I said that whatever happens to his processor is out of my control. I did my part in selling a fully functional product, and thoroughly emphasized all the risks involved, not to mention the correct procedures. It's up to him to follow them and take good care of his CPU.

**UPDATE #3:** To clarify even further, I did let him know that, while still within Intel's ""safe"" standards, his temps were a bit too high (especially after he shared an actual [HWiNFO 64 screenshot of the CPU load during a gaming session](https://i.ibb.co/CsYjXD9/temps.jpg)), and my personal recommendation was to buy some more Conductonaut and apply the liquid metal again, making sure to follow all of my instructions the second time.

He agreed and was very understanding, thanking me and saying that he'd positively qualify the sale. All in all, a very pleasant experience (even if it started by almost giving me a panic attack)."
Android,"I know the title is rather sensational, however it couldn't get any closer to the truth.

For those who are too busy to read the whole post, here's the TL;DR version: **The   storage scanner in the Device Care section is made by a super shady   Chinese data-mining/antivirus company called Qihoo 360. It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).

This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r/samsung](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/) and [r/galaxys10](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.

For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.

If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line ""powered by 360"". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo\_360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo_360)).

If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998](https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.

With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \[dot\] cn, wshifen \[dot\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https://imgur.com/EtfInqv](https://imgur.com/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.

Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their ""Big Data   platform"", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).

I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.

After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.

Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?

This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the ""nothing to hide"" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.

**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  
To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them."

Can anyone let me know how I can create a problem on my laptop (a macbook) that he can easily solve, but also isn’t intuitive so he doesn’t think I’m a complete dumbass?"
asktechnology,"Hello Reddit

Sorry if this isn't the best place for this post.

First time poster. Be easy.

The small start up I work for held a company-wide meeting today. Today was my day off so a Zoom link was sent to me.

I have to download the Zoom app to join the meeting, I do so and 'dial in'. I wasn't told I would be video conferencing so that's not what I expected.

The app asked permission for my mic. I allowed. I expected another prompt asking about video but no. So I join the meeting.

Now, the entire time I'm assuming I've only joined audio, I'm not on video.

I assume this because: 

-I never gave the app permission

-I never saw myself on the screen

-There was a big red camera icon with a line through it at the bottom the screen 'START VIDEO'...meaning video was never enabled. Right? RIGHT?

I walked around my apartment in a very work-inappropriate top, went to the bathroom, walked into the next room and did other things while I only listened...

Worst of all though

Upon seeing a coworker who I've only met through text and emails, seeing how surprisingly handsome he was, I lost my shit. I silently blew kisses, kissed my phone screen, smushed the screen to my titties, etc.

Ya know, the kinds of things we do when we think no one is watching. Not thinking twice because I know I'm not on camera.

Now I'm thinking, 'could I have been on screen?' What if I actually did video conference in. WHAT IF IT WASN'T JUST AUDIO DEAR GOD

Zoom users. Please.

Please give me peace of mind. You must tap the red 'START VIDEO' icon to enable video in a meeting, correct?

I mean, seems pretty obvious but I need confirmation to be able to sleep tonight.

Thank you!"
asktechnology,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel in India, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

asktechnology,"Technically speaking, dark mode UI has been possible since the rise of color CRT monitors in the early 90s. I remember Windows 95/98 having a reverse color appearance setting for instance. And there were custom themes you could install in Linux and the classic Mac OS that were basically dark mode. Why has it only become popular in the past few years?"
asktechnology,"Hi everyone, not sure if this is the correct subreddit for this, but it seemed pretty appropriate. Please advise on where I could cross post if any of you suggest. 

Here's the lowdown:

Since 2008, my father and I have been working on what we call *The Magnetic Torque Multiplier*, but it's also known as the *Permanent Magnetic Drive Apparatus and Operational Method* - at least that's what is on our patent which can be seen [here.](https://www.google.com/patents/US8487484?dq=magnetic+torque+multiplier&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LZ3GVPeDC4SfggSl6IHwCQ&ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA) So if anyone is keen on going through the patent and reading about how it works, please feel free, we're pretty proud of it. 

Anyway, we have reached an ending point. What we want to do is get a magazine article written on our product with a history of the project, how it currently runs, what the future possibilities will be, and some cool pictures go to along with it. Perhaps Popular Science or Popular Mechanics? I hear that sometimes they love stories/products like this for an article.

What do you guys suggest? Many thanks!"
